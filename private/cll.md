# Chronic Lymphcytic Leukemia (CLL)
- Type of blood cancer
- Most common type of leukemia in adults in Western countries
- Tends to be harder to cure than acute leukemia
- A cancer of B lymphocytes, which normally make antibodies that fight infection
  - Because of the CLL, the B lymphocytes don't work as they should

## Two different forms
- Slow-growing
  - Increased number of lymphocytes but normal or slightly-below-normal level of red cells, platelets, and neutrophils
    - Low amounts of ZAP-70 and CD38 proteins indicate slow-growing CLL
- Fast-growing
  - Too many CLL cells in the blood that block normal cell production

## How it develops
- DNA of a developing stem cell in the bone marrow is damaged (an "acquired mutation")
  - It is unknown how this damage occurs
    - *Stem cells* form blood cells (red cells, white cells, platelets)
- This damaged cell becomes a leukemic cell and multiplies.  The CLL cells grow and survive better than normal cells.
- As a result, the number of healthy blood cells is lower than normal.

# Causes
Unknown.

Possible causes:
- Herbicides (Agent Orange)
- Benzene
- Exposure to ionizing radiation

# Symptoms
- Fatigue
- Night sweats / chills
- Unexplained weight loss
- Low-grade fever
- Enlarged lymph nodes
- Enlarged spleen or liver
- Infections due to low immunoglobulin levels and decreased neutrophil counts

# Prognosis
## Staging
Two systems:  Rai (US), Binet (Europe)

### Rai
- Rai stage 0: Lymphocytosis; no enlargement of the lymph nodes, spleen, or liver; red blood cell and platelet counts are near normal.
- Rai stage I: Lymphocytosis; enlarged lymph nodes; spleen and liver are not enlarged; red blood cell and platelet counts are near normal.
- Rai stage II: Lymphocytosis; enlarged spleen (and maybe an enlarged liver); lymph nodes may or may not be enlarged; red blood cell and platelet counts are near normal.
- Rai stage III: Lymphocytosis; lymph nodes, spleen, or liver may or may not be enlarged; red blood cell counts are low (anemia); platelet counts are near normal.
- Rai stage IV: Lymphocytosis; enlarged lymph nodes, spleen, or liver; red blood cell counts may be low or near normal; platelet counts are low (thrombocytopenia).

## Prognostic factors
### Adverse
- Diffuse pattern of bone marrow (more widespread replacement of normal marrow by leukemia)
- Advanced age
- Deletions of parts of chromosomes 17 or 11
- Trisomy 12 in CLL cells
- High blood levels of beta-2-microglobulin
- Lymphocyte doubling time of less than 1 year
- Increased fraction of prolymphocytes
- High proportion of CLL cells containing ZIP-70 (20% or more), CD38 (30% or more)
- CLL cells with unmutated gene for immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV)
- CLL cells absent of TP53 gene

### Favorable
- Non-diffuse (nodular or interstitial) pattern of bone marrow
- Deletion of part of chromosome 13
- CLL cells with a mutated gene for IGHV

# Treatment

# Related
- *Anemia*: low red blood cells (causes fatigue, shortness of breath)
- *Leukopenia*: low white blood cells
  - *Neutropenia*: low levels of neutrophils
    - *Neutrophils*: a type of white blood cell that fights infection
- *Lymphocytosis*: excess numbers of lymphocytes
  - *Lymphocytes*: a type of white blood cell
    - In CLL, this is the type of cell where leukemia starts
- *Thrombocytopenia*: low number of platelets (causing bleeding, easy bruising)
