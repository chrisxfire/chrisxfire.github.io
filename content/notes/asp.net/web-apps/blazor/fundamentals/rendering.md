# [overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-9.0)
To *render* means to produce the HTML markup that browsers display. 
Razor components are either *statically* or *interactively* rendered, and rendered either *client-side* or *server-side*.

# rendering concepts
## static vs. interactive rendering
- Static rendering â€” always server-side
  - The component is rendered without interaction between the user and .NET/C# code.
  - JavaScript and DOM events process normally, but no user events on the client can be processed.
- Interactive rendering
  - The component can process .NET events via C# code.
  - Server-side 
    - by the ASP.NET Core runtime
  - Client-side
    - in the browser (in the Blazor WASM runtime)

## pre-rendering
The process of initially rendering page content on the server without event handlers for rendered controls.
