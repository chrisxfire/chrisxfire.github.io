ASP.NET Core apps, aside from serving pages and responding to requests via web APIs, can also communicate directly with connected clients.  This is usally done via WebSockets.  SignalR is a library that implements WebSockets and other transport technologies.

Use cases:
- Live chat apps
- Monitoring apps
- job progress updates
- Notifications
- Interactive forms apps
