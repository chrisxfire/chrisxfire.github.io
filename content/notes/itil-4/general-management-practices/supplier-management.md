General information
2.1 Purpose and description
Key message

The purpose of the supplier management practice is to ensure that the organization’s suppliers and their performances are managed appropriately to support the seamless provision of quality products and services. This includes creating closer, more collaborative relationships with key suppliers to uncover and realize new value and reduce the risk of failure.

Supplier management ensures effective use of third-party services by establishing a common approach to sourcing strategy and managing supplier relationships and by maintaining a single point of control over the active and planned supplier contracts and services.

The supplier management practice enables organizations to define strategies for the use of suppliers’ and partners’ services, to evaluate and select suppliers, and to ensure that consumed services meet or exceed agreed service levels, the cost of the consumed services is optimal, and associated risks are understood and controlled.

The sourcing strategy should support the overall organization’s strategy and define which of the organization’s resources should be created and managed internally and which may be obtained from and/or managed by third parties, and to what extent. It should also define the overall approach to managing third-party services; it can in turn be retained or delegated to a key supplier, or to a specialized service integrator. Policies and guidelines defined in the sourcing strategy have significant impact on the organization’s products and services, as well as on the organization’s structure and allocation of responsibilities. Regardless of the approach selected, no organization today is fully self-sufficient: every organization depends on third parties to some extent. Therefore, the supplier management practice is one of the key elements of overall success for the organization.

The supplier management practice ensures that the right supplier is evaluated and selected to deliver quality products and services that are aligned to the overall business objectives, essentially meeting the utility and warranty commitments. It ensures that suppliers enable the realization of the desired outcomes and meet or exceed the organization’s requirements for service and product quality, while minimizing the risks related to the delivery (in line with the overall risk appetite of the organization). Flexibility and agility are the key aspects of a modern organization and are also the key expectations from the suppliers.

The supplier management practice is used in close conjunction with other practices, including the relationship management, service level management, service financial management, risk management, and service configuration management practices.

2.2 Terms and concepts
Definition: Supplier

A stakeholder responsible for providing services that are used by an organization.

An engagement with a new supplier usually starts with assessing what suppliers are in the market and approaching them with a request for information, a quote, a proposal, a bid, or a demonstration (RfX).

Definition: RfX

This umbrella term is used to reference to request for information (RFI), request for proposal (RFP), request for quote (RFQ), request for bid (RFB), or request for demonstration (RFD).

A relationship with a new or existing supplier is generally defined by the contract that the organization has with them.

The contract typically includes the service level agreement between the organization and supplier, covering the utility and warranty aspects of the services, terms and conditions, and payment schedules. It details the parties’ commitments, including responsibilities and deliverables, the parameters that are to be used to measure the supplier’s performance, and related reward or penalty attributes.

2.2.1 Supplier evaluation and supplier performance
Contracting a supplier happens as a result of supplier evaluation and selection. To evaluate a potential supplier and consequently assess its performance, an organization must have a supplier assessment framework.

Before suppliers are selected to deliver products or services, they are evaluated based on several factors. Organizations must brief the suppliers on the evaluation process and criteria.

Organizations may have different approaches for different suppliers, depending on the type of relationship and level of trust. However, all suppliers must be evaluated and assessed for their performance and value realization.

The suppliers must be appraised against defined performance targets to assess their effectiveness. These performance targets usually include the utility and warranty aspects and metrics related to the co-creation of value. Organizations must brief the suppliers on the criteria and the scoring process in advance.

2.3 Scope
The supplier management practice focuses on three key aspects:

evaluating, selecting, and onboarding suppliers, and maintaining of their information in the supplier management information systems
negotiating of contracts and ensuring that suppliers adhere to them, meeting all contractual obligations and deliverables and managing the contracts through their lifecycle
measuring, tracking, and reporting on supplier performance and triggering the reward or penalty aspects of the contract, ensuring that the organization obtains value for money from the contracts.
The scope of the supplier management practice includes:

enforcing the supplier management policy
creating and maintaining the supplier selection and performance evaluation criteria and procedures
establishing and maintaining the sourcing strategy and supplier categorization standards in accordance with the sourcing strategy
defining of sourcing requirements and evaluation parameters for supplier selection
creating and maintaining standard contract terms and conditions
evaluating and selecting suppliers
developing, negotiating, and agreeing contracts
reviewing, renewing, and terminating contracts
auditing the suppliers’ adherence to the contract
measuring and reporting on supplier performance
creating, maintaining, and using supplier onboarding and offboarding procedures
creating and maintaining supplier performance measurement criteria
collaborating and resolving conflicts with suppliers
maintaining the data in supplier management information systems
categorizing suppliers and managing risk
identifying, tracking, and reporting on continual improvement measures related to the supplier management practice or suppliers.
There are several activities and areas of responsibility that are not included in the supplier management practice, although they are still closely related to supplier management. These are listed in Table 2.1, along with references to the practices in which they can be found. It is important to remember that ITIL practices are merely collections of tools to use in the context of value streams; they should be combined as necessary, depending on the situation.

2.4 Practice success factors
Definition: Practice success factor

A complex functional component of a practice that is required for the practice to fulfil its purpose.

A practice success factor (PSF) is more than a task or activity, as it includes components of all four dimensions of service management. The nature of the activities and resources of PSFs within a practice may differ, but together they ensure that the practice is effective.

The supplier management practice includes the following PSFs:

ensuring that the sourcing strategy and guidelines effectively support the organization’s strategy
ensuring that service relationships with all suppliers and partners are managed effectively and in line with internal and external regulations
ensuring the effective integration of third-party services into the organization’s products and services.
2.4.1 Ensuring that the sourcing strategy and guidelines effectively support the organization’s strategy
As part of strategy management, organizations define their sourcing policy, including principles and criteria for sourcing resources. According to this policy, a sourcing strategy is developed and maintained to ensure the alignment of the business needs and supplier targets. Apart from the sourcing principles and criteria, it includes supplier categorization, requirements for suppliers of each category, and basic rules of supplier relationship management.

The sourcing strategy is supported with guidelines covering key aspects of the practice, including:

the management of the service relationship at every step of the service journey
the management of contracts and agreements with suppliers
supplier performance management and reporting
the integration of third-party services into the organization’s products and services.
Organizations need to have the right procedures to identify suppliers as potential sourcing partners and categorize them based on the sourcing strategy. These procedures establish a framework to drive contractual compliance by suppliers, conduct periodic audits, and measure, analyse, review, and report on the performance of each supplier. This forms the key input for the supplier reviews and for the organizations to reward or penalize suppliers based on their performance.

Organizations should be able to effectively formulate contracts and agreements, evaluate and negotiate contract terms, and review contracts for renewal and/or termination.

The contractual compliance and supplier performance can be measured in terms of: contract adherence, SLA performance, compliance, innovation and improvement commitments, resourcing commitments, and value co-creation.

Managing suppliers involves ensuring that contracts are cost effective and provide value for money. This can be measured in terms of the year-on-year benefit or the potential value (financial saving, innovation, transformation, and so on) that suppliers bring as part of their offering.

2.4.2 Ensuring that service relationships with all suppliers and partners are managed effectively and in line with internal and external regulations
Every organization acts as a service provider and as a service consumer. Service relationships with suppliers follow the same journey as service relationships with the organization’s service consumers, although the journey is perceived from the other side. The service relationship journey steps are shown in Figure 2.1 (see section 1.2 of ITIL® 4: Drive Stakeholder Value for more details on the service relationship journey).


Figure 2.1 The service relationship journey

When organizations act as the service consumer, they follow the customer’s side of the journey, and suppliers follow the service provider’s side. Each step of the journey should be supported with procedures, skills and competencies, information, and tools; sometimes external services are used too. Many of these are considered part of the supplier management practice, but input from and the involvement of other practices is needed at every step, as is shown in Table 2.2.

Specific solutions for every step vary depending on factors such as scale, type of service relationship, category of supplier(s), nature of the services they provide, and so on. Therefore, the supplier management practice should ensure the effective management of service relationships with all suppliers.

There are different approaches to establish supplier relationships based on the type of relationship required: basic, cooperative, or partnership. The relationship is dictated by the dependency that the organization has on the supplier or the need for strategic alignment.

In cooperative and partnership service relationships, organizations need to create and maintain a closer relationship with and between suppliers so that products are supported and services are provided seamlessly; they have means to address any conflict that can potentially arise between suppliers during product or service delivery. The supplier management practice ensures the effectiveness of supplier collaboration and conflict resolution, which can be measured in terms of clarity of collaboration clauses, supplier coordination, conflict handling, human resources, funding and knowledge contribution (or deficiency) by suppliers, and cultural dimensions.

Also, depending on the type of service relationship, the supplier performance measurement parameters need to be clearly articulated to ensure the right level of visibility into supplier performance. Supplier performance measurement parameters include parameters related to warranty, financial savings or returns, improvement or innovations, proactive initiatives, and collaboration. In a basic relationship, supplier performance measures are restricted to warranty parameters: in a cooperative relationship, they would include all parameters except that for innovation.

2.4.3 Ensure the effective integration of third-party services into the organization’s products and services
Third-party services form an important part of resources that organizations manage in order to create and deliver their products and services. Depending on the sourcing strategy, the level of integration of third-party services into organizations may vary, but most organizations have critical dependencies where core products and services may become unavailable in case of a major disruption of some of external services. The following is critical to effectively manage external services in the organization’s context:

understanding the external service’s scope, nature, and terms of provision
understanding the dependencies
understanding the risks
considering the dependencies and associated risks from the early steps of product design and along the product and service lifecycle.
To ensure these, the supplier management practice should be used in conjunction with other practices, including the architecture management, risk management, service design, business analysis, service configuration management, and service financial management practices.

At the operational level, the supplier management practice should support value streams dealing with third-party services and components; it is likely that the majority of organization’s value streams will need supplier management.

The onboarding and offboarding of suppliers must be done with the right procedures and an accurate means to capture or update the supplier dependency matrix, in alignment with the service relationship type. This is needed to seamlessly support the provisioning of continuous quality products and services to the business, especially during the period of supplier transition. This can be measured in terms of timeliness and effectiveness of the supplier onboarding and offboarding processes and procedures, and the accuracy of the supplier dependency matrix.

2.5 Key Metrics
The effectiveness and performance of the ITIL practices should be assessed within the context of the value streams to which each practice contributes. As with the performance of any tool, the practice’s performance can only be assessed in the context of its application. However, tools can differ greatly in design and quality, and these differences define a tool’s potential or capability to be effective when used according to its purpose. Further guidance on metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other techniques that can help with this can be found in the measurement and reporting practice guide.

Key metrics for the supplier management practice are mapped to its PSFs. They can be used as KPIs in the context of value streams to assess the contribution of the supplier management practice to the effectiveness and efficiency of those value streams. Some examples of key metrics are given in Table 2.3.

Table 2.3 Examples of key metrics for the practice success factors
Practice success factors	Key metrics
Ensuring that the sourcing strategy and guidelines effectively support the organization’s strategy	Number and impact of cases where strategic objectives could not be achieved due to dependencies on third parties
Number of strategic objectives not supported by the sourcing strategy
Number of sourcing strategy objectives that are not linked to the organization's strategy
Ensuring that service relationships with all suppliers and partners are managed effectively and in line with internal and external regulations	Stakeholders' satisfaction with the organization's relationships with third parties
Number and impact of breaches to relevant internal and external regulations
Realized value from relationships with suppliers and partners, including benefits, risks, and costs
Ensuring the effective integration of third-party services into the organization’s products and services	Stakeholders' satisfaction with third parties' integration into organization's value streams
Number and impact of losses, delays, and other forms of waste within organization's value stream caused by ineffective third-party integration
Number of incidents and SLA breaches associated with third-party participation in the organization's value streams
The correct aggregation of metrics into complex indicators will make it easier to use the data for the ongoing management of value streams, and for the periodic assessment and continual improvement of the supplier management practice. There is no single best solution. Metrics will be based on the overall service strategy and priorities of an organization, as well as on the goals of the value streams to which the practice contributes. 

3. 
Value Streams and processes
3.1 Value stream contribution
Like any other ITIL management practice, the supplier management practice contributes to multiple value streams. It is important to remember that a value stream is never formed from a single practice. The supplier management practice combines with other practices to provide high-quality services to consumers. The main value chain activities to which the practice contributes are:

engage
design and transition
deliver and support
improve
obtain/build
plan.
The contribution of the supplier management practice to the service value chain is shown in Figure 3.1.

Image of Figure 3.1 shows Heat map of the contribution of the Supplier Management practice to Value Chain activities

Figure 3.1 Heat map of the contribution of the supplier management practice to value chain activities

3.2 Processes
Each practice may include one or more processes and activities that may be necessary to fulfil the purpose of that practice.

Definition: Process

A set of interrelated or interacting activities that transform inputs into outputs. A process takes one or more defined inputs and turns them into defined outputs. Processes define the sequence of actions and their dependencies.

The supplier management practice activities form two main processes:

managing a common approach to supplier management
managing supplier journeys.
3.2.1 Managing a common approach to supplier management
This process is focused on defining, agreeing, and promoting an organization-wide approach to managing suppliers. It includes the activities listed in Table 3.1 and transforms the inputs into outputs.

Table 3.2 Activities of the managing a common approach to supplier management process
Activity

Example

Develop and agree the sourcing strategy

The sourcing strategy defines the organization’s approach to supplier management, aligned with the organization’s strategy.

The sourcing strategy and guidelines define how the organization deals with:

supplier category and applicable service relationships
supplier evaluation criteria
supplier shortlisting
due diligence
supplier selection
compliance and regulations
contracting
contract compliance and audit standards and periodicity
reward and penalty mechanisms
service integration/disintegration options
collaboration guidelines
performance measurement
reporting and communication standards.
Develop and agree the supplier management procedures

A team of stakeholders involved in supplier management further develops the sourcing strategy by developing and agreeing guidelines and procedures for:

Identifying available suppliers: this defines how the preliminary requirements are developed and how the potential suppliers are identified.
Engaging with suppliers and communicating demand: this defines how the potential suppliers are approached and engaged and what channels and forms are used for communications. Some organizations where the duties of supplier selection and operational management of suppliers are segregated can also define an empanelment procedure. Empanelment can run as an independent exercise or through the RFI. The supplier empanelment procedure covers the conditions and requirements for empanelment and the empanelment workflow.
Supplier evaluation and selection: this defines how to evaluate suppliers during the selection process. The criteria describing supplier impact and importance, risks associated with the supplier, and costs and value offering can be used to score the suppliers. Each of the criteria can be scored based on a simple score or weighted score. In addition to the technical proposition, the evaluation parameters include the supplier’s service delivery track record, capability and references aligned to the services being outsourced. Additionally, the credit rating and organization’s size may be the other parameters to be considered during evaluation.
Supplier contracting: this defines the steps to be followed during the negotiation, formulation, maintenance, and management of contracts. The structure for various types of contracts covering basic, cooperating, and partnership service relationship types needs to be documented. Contract frameworks acts as a model for all contracts related to the type of service and service relationship. The procedure for the maintenance and management of contracts covers the contractual compliance and audit guidance, periodicity of such audits and corresponding actions for non-compliance and the review process. It also provides guidance related to:
requirements for contract amendment
contract renewal
contract termination
contract expiration.
Supplier onboarding and offboarding: this defines how suppliers are onboarded and enabled to provide services in organization’s cultural, financial, and operational context. These procedures should also include enabling users and stakeholders to consume suppliers’ services.
These procedures should include service integration to coordinate or orchestrate all the suppliers involved in the development and delivery of products and services. Service integration builds a supplier into the end-to-end provision of services, ensuring control of all interfaces and outcomes from suppliers, and facilitating collaboration between suppliers. Procedures should define how the suppliers are offboarded and how access, dependencies, changes to service integration, non-disclosures, and risks and compliance issues are handled.

Managing consumption and monitoring supplier performance: this defines how the organization manages the ongoing service delivery by suppliers and service interactions. This includes procedures for managing stakeholder satisfaction, maximizing the value of the service consumption, decreasing the costs connected with service consumption, managing risks and compliance, improving collaboration and the service mindset, resolving conflicts, and service exceptions. Supplier performance monitoring, assessment, and review is an evaluation criteria that will be used for the ongoing monitoring of supplier performance, methods of monitoring and value realization assessment techniques, reporting procedures, exceptions handling, continual improvement, and periodic reviews.
Supplier assessment and review: this defines the value realization assessment techniques, reporting procedures, exceptions handling, continual improvement, and periodic reviews.
Managing supplier governance, risk, and compliance throughout the supplier journey: supplier risk management procedures must be created, outlining initial risk reviews and due diligence of the potential suppliers, ongoing risk management, monitoring compliance, and running supplier audits, metrics, and KPIs. The key aspect here is the design of the governance organization that steers the way suppliers’ risks and compliance are to be managed and suppliers governed. Therefore, the governance body for supplier management might be established based on the organization’s size, supplier ecosystem, and requirements. Such a body would be focusing on managing and governing:
supplier risks
cross-supplier collaboration and service integration
contractual adherence
compliance
supplier audits.
Communicate and embed the sourcing strategy and procedures

The agreed strategy and procedures are communicated and discussed with the supplier management stakeholders across the organization. Stakeholders may decide the level of formality for the training on sourcing strategy and supplier management. For the people involved in supplier management on a daily basis, policies and controls may be created for formal training as a prerequisite, as well as periodic awareness training.

External communications on the sourcing strategy, supplier management procedures, service integration approach, and organizational principles and culture must be prepared and published in the channels agreed by the strategy.

Technical details of the integration for potential suppliers should also be formulated and published. This includes technical standards and methods of integration used by the organization; for example, API management.

Review and adjust the sourcing strategy and procedures

Supplier management stakeholders monitor and review the adoption, compliance, and effectiveness of the agreed sourcing strategy and procedures; this is done on event-based (supplier-related incidents, conflicts, crises, and complaints on inadequate supplier base that cannot support products and services) and interval-based basis. Resulting findings and initiatives are used as input for continual improvement.

3.2.2 Managing supplier journeys
This process is focused on managing suppliers through their journey. It includes the activities listed in Table 3.3 and transforms the inputs into outputs.

Activity

Example

Identifying available suppliers

Fundamentally, at this stage members of the sourcing team draft the details of what needs to be sourced and assess the options that existing suppliers, internal providers, or the markets provide. Preliminary lists of potential suppliers can be formed at this stage, or preliminary selection criteria can be defined to enable automated filtering.

It is important to analyse and understand the business requirements before initiating the supplier selection. The requirements may be due to:

a new service
a change to an existing service
changes to the suppliers as result of supplier review, due to dissatisfaction from the services provided by the incumbent supplier, supplier consolidation exercise (could also be due to merger and acquisition may result in having multiple supplier with similar services), and so on.
The extent to which the contribution from and involvement of the supplier is required forms the basis of the sound design of services and subsequently the successful service provision by the suppliers. This forms the foundation for the requirement from suppliers or the new contracts.

Depending on the need, an approach to sourcing could be identified, including in/outsourcing, type of relationship preferred, service integration approach, and so on.

Based on their relative importance and service relationship type, potential suppliers can be categorized as:

generic or commodity suppliers mapping to the basic service relationship
operational and tactical suppliers mapping to the cooperative service relationship
Strategic suppliers or ‘partners’ mapping to the partnership service relationship.
These categories of suppliers are significant and are generally aligned to the long-term plan for the organization.

Engaging with suppliers and communicating demand

To engage with the suppliers, an organization may decide to involve an intermediary to create the RfX and to manage the entire supplier evaluation and selection process or may involve its internal sourcing/procurement management team to do the same. In case this is created internally, the supplier manager or contracts manager owns the creation and communication of RfX. Communication channels may differ for different suppliers, based on the type of relationship with them and level of formality or trust this type dictates.

An appointed sourcing team member ensures that the RfX has the details of the selection process and criteria, overview of the business, detailed requirements and specifications (including service specifications, service level requirements, service continuity requirements, and so on), terms and conditions, and other details that would drive the selection of suppliers and the contract process.

RfX is then placed in all the communication channels agreed by the sourcing strategy for supplier engagement.

Evaluating and selecting suppliers

When suppliers respond to the RfX according to the defined schedule, the sourcing team ensures that the response is evaluated based on the defined evaluation criteria.

Based on the evaluation of the response, the predefined number of suppliers, generally the top two or three, are selected for the final round of evaluation and negotiation. The sourcing team communicates the decision to the selected suppliers.

Besides the predefined selection criteria, the sourcing team may ask the potential suppliers to demonstrate the service or similar.

Based on the detailed requirements, evaluation criteria, and results from further evaluation (proof of concept, demos, minimal viable products developed, and so on), one or more suppliers are chosen for contract negotiations.

Contracting suppliers

The purpose of this activity is to develop, negotiate, review, update, finalize, and award supplier contracts.

Organizations should also have an appropriate structure for formulating contracts, evaluating and negotiating contract terms, and reviewing the contracts for renewal and/or termination.

The type of relationship with the supplier dictates how the organization manages the risks associated with the supplier and therefore affects the level of formality in contracts (less trust: more formality). Generally, contracts need to clearly document:

the roles and responsibilities of the parties
warranty targets
utility targets
service experience targets
other service specific requirements and terms of service consumption as well as delivery.
Contract management covers the creation of new contract, contract amendment, contract renewal, and termination of contracts.

After the suppliers are selected, due diligence is conducted, and the appointed sourcing team member, such as the contracts manager, shortlists the final supplier based on the outcome. The negotiation covers a detailed description of services and service performance, a statement of work (for waterfall projects), some form of scope framework (for Agile development), technical schedules, payment schedules, and so on. During negotiations, the contract is legally framed.

The contracts manager frames the new contract based on the RfX requirements and the supplier’s response. This covers all of the technical schedules or statements of work. It is a master services agreement covering the terms and conditions, performance baselines and expectations, and reward and penalty mechanisms.

On the other hand, there may be a need to amend an existing contract, which may be trigged as a result of:

dependency on a new contract being framed
requirement changes in an existing contract
technological changes
mergers and acquisitions or spin-offs
new services or changes to an existing service
performance levels achieved during the contract review period
new performance metrics and measurement methodologies to be introduced.
In the case of multi-supplier environment, suppliers collaborating towards realizing the common end objective of the business is critical and is also a key element towards value co-creation. Therefore, the new contract or an amendment can have the set of collaboration or service integration clauses directed at ensuring that suppliers are accountable for collaborating with each other or agreeing to the existing service integration structure. This is especially important for cooperative and partnership relationship types.

After the contract or the amendment is finalized, it is signed by the signing authority of the parties involved. Once the contract is signed, the overall execution, monitoring, and management of the contract is performed by the contracts manager. This is an ongoing activity during the entire lifecycle of the contract.

If the organization takes a decision to not continue with the supplier’s services, then it results in contract termination. This may be due to supplier’s performance not being in-line with the organizations’ expectations, supplier consolidation, mergers and acquisitions, or other reasons that may result in a need to discontinue the supplier’s services. The supplier manager initiates the termination of the contract and the contracts manager terminates the contract as needed. Generally, in cases where the services are being retired and are no longer needed, a contract may be allowed to expire.

On/offboarding suppliers

The requirement for a new supplier and/or supplier’s services to be onboarded or offboarded is registered by the supplier on/offboarding coordinator under the direction from the supplier manager. The onboarding and/or offboarding requirements may cover the services and sub-services, supplier’s processes and tools, and supplier’s team members. The onboarding and/or the offboarding plan is created along with the cutover plan leading to the go-live of (or switch to) new supplier services. Also, associated risks are identified, documented, and tracked as part of the risk register.

It is important that the supplier dependency mapping of services to the service providers and to the contracts is updated with the new supplier and/or service details or with the details of the supplier and/or services being offboarded.

When onboarding a supplier, the organization’s resources that the supplier will have access to must be detailed. The supplier manager or a sourcing team member (for example, the supplier on/offboarding coordinator) ensures that these activities are performed. The supplier team members are onboarded and required access provided. The supplier onboarding coordinator ensures that the service catalogue is updated with:

new services
the mapping of services to the supplier and appropriate supplier teams.
Also, as part of onboarding, the sourcing team categorizes the supplier based on their relevant importance to the organization, which depends on the service relationship and the associated risks. Therefore, the categorization ensures that the time spent on managing the suppliers is in line with their significance in the supplier ecosystem.

It is important to remember that, along with the supplier onboarding, the organization runs user onboarding and enablement, but this is out of scope of this practice.

As part of supplier offboarding, the supplier offboarding coordinator identifies the organization’s resources that supplier was leveraging, as well as their integration.

During offboarding, the following activities are performed:

the organization's access to supplier's resources is revoked
the supplier's access to the organization's resources is revoked
all relevant people are made aware of the offboarding.
These activities are completed in accordance with the supplier offboarding procedure and are tracked by the offboarding coordinator or other appointed sourcing team member.

Managing consumption and monitoring supplier performance

After the supplier is onboarded, the organization must ensure effective and efficient service consumption by following procedures defined by the sourcing strategy, including procedures for managing stakeholder satisfaction, maximizing the value of the service consumption, decreasing costs connected with service consumption, managing risks and compliance, improving collaboration and the service mindset, resolving conflicts, service exceptions, and contract deviations, and ensuring effective supplier monitoring.

Rating the supplier based on their performance is a key for effective service delivery, especially in the multi-supplier ecosystem that is prevalent in nearly every organization today. Therefore, defining the criteria based on which the supplier performance would be measured, forms a critical aspect of supplier management. With the digital enterprises and new generation delivery models like bi-modal IT, DevOps, and so on, the importance of a multi-facet supplier measurement system becomes even more important.

Performance measurement criteria include performance KPIs and related metrics, expected performance, measurement methodology for each KPI, and the way the performance would be reported. This includes reports, dashboards, and supplier scorecards.

Once the supplier performance criteria are implemented and operationalized, a team member is responsible for monitoring the supplier and the supplier’s performance. As part of this activity, the team collects the performance metrics and creates, and publishes the supplier performance reports, dashboards, and scorecards.

Businesses need to be protected from poor supplier performance or disruption; for example, the availability of services does not need to be compromised due to supplier performance. Organizations should establish the appropriate structure and governance to drive contractual compliance by suppliers, conduct periodic audits, and measure, analyse, review, and report on the performance of each supplier. This forms the key input to the organizations to reward or penalize suppliers based on their performance.

Supplier performance reports and scorecards serve as an input into periodic supplier reviews.

Assess and review the suppliers

Based on the reports from supplier monitoring and other related service consumption data, supplier value realization assessments are made. These assessments drive supplier reviews.

Supplier reviews lead to improvement initiatives to the sourcing strategy, policy and procedures, evaluation and selection procedures, supplier performance monitoring, and audits.

Organizations and people
4.1 Roles, competencies, and responsibilities
The practice guides do not describe the practice management roles such as practice owners, practice lead, or practice coach. They instead focus on the specialist roles that are specific to each practice. The structure and naming of each role may differ from organization to organization, so any roles defined in ITIL should not be treated as mandatory, or even recommended. Remember, roles are not job titles. One person can take on multiple roles and one role can be assigned to multiple people.

Roles are described in the context of processes and activities. Each role is characterized with a competency profile based on the model shown in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1 Competency codes and profiles
Competency code

Competency profile (activities and skills)

L

Leader. Decision-making, delegating, overseeing other activities, providing incentives and motivation, and evaluating outcomes

T

Technical expert. Providing technical (IT) expertise and conducting expertise-based assignments.

Two practice-specific roles may be found in organizations: supplier manager and supplier coordinator. These roles are often introduced in organizations where the number of suppliers and contracts to manage is high. These roles can be combined or separated depending on the organizational structure and amount of supplier management work.

4.2 Organizational structures and teams
It is unusual to see a dedicated organizational structure for the supplier management practice. Typically, the supplier manager and coordinator roles are associated with a formal job title under the supplier, vendor, or procurement management function, while the contract manager role is often associated with the legal function. Some organizations create committees (service committee, service quality committees, supplier governance committees, procurement committees, and so on) to address the strategic and tactical aspects of service performance and supplier governance.

5. 
Information and technology
5.1 Information exchange
The effectiveness of the supplier management practice is based on the quality of the information used. This information includes, but is not limited to, information about:

customers and users
services and their mapping to suppliers
the organization’s requirements for the services and service dependencies
existing partners and suppliers, including contract, SLA, and KPI information on the services they provide
policies and requirements which regulate supplier management, supplier on/offboarding, supplier collaboration, contract formulation and governance, and conflict resolving and performance management
improvement initiatives by suppliers and related value realization
on/offboarding status, contract adherence, supplier performance, and conflicts
stakeholder satisfaction with the suppliers
market state and trends, emerging technologies, services, and suppliers.
This information may take various forms. The key inputs and outputs of the practice are listed in section 3.

5.2 Automation and tooling
In most cases, the supplier management practice can significantly benefit from automation. Where this is possible and effective, it may involve the solutions outlined in Table 5.1.

6. 
Partners and suppliers
Very few services are delivered using only an organization’s own resources. Most, if not all, depend on other services, often provided by third parties outside the organization (see section 2.4 of ITIL Foundation: ITIL 4 Edition for a model of a service relationship). Relationships and dependencies introduced by supporting services are described in the practice guides for portfolio management, service financial management, information security management, service continuity management, and service level management. Information about dependencies on third-party services is used in supplier management as part of requirements for the sourcing of partners and suppliers, evaluation of partners and suppliers, contract negotiation, and contract formulation.

The supplier management practice enables the evaluation, selection, and sourcing of the suppliers and partners supporting the organization’s requirement for services. Therefore, it cannot be outsourced. However, some activities of supplier management may be delegated in certain cases, as shown in Table 6.1.

Table 6.1 Outsourcing of supplier management activities
Activity

Outsourcing opportunities

Definition of requirements and drafting of requirements documents

A third party may act as an agent to collect the requirements and draft the requirement documents on behalf of the IT organization

Manage supplier selection process

A third party may act as an agent for day-to-day operational coordination with potential supplier and partners participating in the selection process

Supplier and partner response evaluation and selection

A third party may act as an agent to do the initial evaluation of supplier response and thus assist in supplier and partner selection

Contract drafting and negotiation

A third party may act as an agent to assist in drafting the contract as well as assist in contract negotiation

Contract and performance audits

A third party may act as an agent to do an independent audit to measure and report on contractual compliance and performance of contracted suppliers and partners

Important reminder
Most of the content of the practice guides should be taken as a suggestion of areas that an organization might consider when establishing and nurturing their own practices. The practice guides are catalogues of topics that organizations might think about, not a list of answers. When using the content of the practice guides, organizations should always follow the ITIL guiding principles:

focus on value
start where you are
progress iteratively with feedback
collaborate and promote visibility
think and work holistically
keep it simple and practical
optimize and automate.
More information on the guiding principles and their application can be found in section 4.3 of ITIL Foundation: ITIL 4 Edition.
