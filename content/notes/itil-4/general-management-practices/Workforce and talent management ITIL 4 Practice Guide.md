## 2. General information

### 2.1 Purpose and description

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Key message</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>The purpose of the workforce and talent management practice is to ensure that the organization has the right people, with the appropriate skills and knowledge, in the correct roles to support its business objectives. This practice covers a broad set of activities focused on successfully engaging with the organization’s employees and people resources, including: planning, recruitment, onboarding, learning and development, performance measurement, and succession planning.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The workforce and talent management practice is focused on the effective management of the organizations and the people dimension of service management within organizations. The scope, form, and institutionalization of this practice might vary depending on multiple factors, including the organization’s mission and the positioning, business and operating models, architecture, competence model, and others.

People are the most valuable asset of every organization; therefore, the effective management of the workforce is critical for an organization’s success. In a digital business environment, competent and motivated teams are extremely important for the creation and continual improvement of digital products. Formed around the organization’s products, these teams are instrumental for the product development and success.

The workforce and talent management practice is often supported by specialized roles and organizational structures; these can be positioned in various ways to support the IT and digital teams:

*   Most organizations have dedicated human resources (HR) management teams responsible for effective workforce and talent management.
*   HR teams may have different levels of expertise and focus to support IT teams:
    *   In some organizations, HR teams focus on core business units, with little resources dedicated to IT workforce and talent management. In these organizations, IT managers take responsibility for many aspects of IT workforce and talent management.
    *   In some organizations, HR professionals pay significant attention to IT workforce and talent management, applying the organization’s workforce and talent management approach to IT teams and employees, teams, competencies, and skills.
    *   In digital and IT-focused organizations, HR teams are primarily focused on IT workforce and talent management.

Either way, it is important to ensure that IT leaders, managers, and teams share responsibilities for effective workforce and talent management with the organization’s HR professionals; teams’ effectiveness, culture and competence, cannot be developed solely by HR professionals or IT managers and the value which HR management brings to an organization, cannot be delivered: it should be co-created by HR professionals, IT managers, and IT staff together.

In today’s VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous) environment, effective workforce and talent management cannot be based on a fixed set of rules and procedures, rigid organizational structures, and predefined sets of competencies. The workforce and talent management practice should be based on the following premises to be effective:

*   organizations are open systems, their relationships with other systems cannot be ignored
*   an organization’s strategies continual evolve, so should the HR strategy
*   digital technologies change the way organizations work and the skills that organizations need
*   decisions should be driven by principles, not rules
*   organizations should recognize and embrace complexity and complexity-driven heuristics
*   organizational agility, adaptability, and efficiency should be enabled by the organizational structure and management practices
*   workforce and talent management is the responsibility of every team, manager, and leader in the organization, not only HR professionals.

### 2.2 Terms and concepts

#### 2.2.1 Evolution of the role of the workforce and talent management practice

The role of the workforce and talent management practice has been evolving for more than a century, from a purely administrative role to a strategic HR management role. This evolution conforms with the changing understanding of the importance of people for an organization’s success (and the definition of that success). Organizations are moving from a focus on profitability to the ‘triple bottom line’, an approach that covers financial, social, and environmental aspects, as shown in Figure 2.1 (Bordoloi et al., 2018). The triple bottom line marks a shift from short-term financial goals to long-term sustainability goals, which is an integrated business method. Sustainable goals not only improve an organization’s brand and reputation, but drive stakeholder value for customers, employees, and society in the form of better health, climate, and resource utilization. Read more on the triple bottom line approach in *ITIL® 4: Drive Stakeholder Value*, section 3.4.

![Image of Figure 2.1 shows Sustainability and the triple bottom line approach](Workforce%20and%20talent%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Picture1.png)

**Figure 2.1 Sustainability and the triple bottom approach**

Value for employees is an important aspect of the triple bottom line approach. It reflects the well-known premise that happy employees make happy customers.

“Focus on making employees happy, and in turn, they will make your customers happy. What’s happening on the inside of the organization is felt on the outside by the customers.”<sup>1</sup>  

![Image of Figure 2.2 shows a diagram representing employee experiences as a key factor of service experience](Workforce%20and%20talent%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Picture2.png)

**Figure 2.2 Employee experience as a key factor of service experience.**<sup><strong>2</strong></sup>

A strategic focus on employees has changed an organizations’ approaches to the workforce and talent management practice. This practice is recognized as important and necessary, and its effect on an organization’s sustainable success is rarely disputed. Stakeholders expect organizations to effectively manage their workforce and talent.

#### 2.2.2 Holistic approach

The workforce and talent management practice cannot be limited to administrative tasks, although these tasks are important. It is more than just recruiting, training, and reviewing employees’ performances, although these are the most visible activities. The practice must be holistic to contribute to value co-creation and the overall strategy of an organization. A well-known and widely adopted human resources management model is the ‘7-S model’ offered by Thomas J. Peters and Robert H. Waterman in their book *In Search of Excellence*<sup><em>3 </em></sup> and known as the ‘McKinsey 7S Framework.<sup>4</sup> The model describes the following elements that need to be managed and balanced for the organization to be successful:

*   shared values (also known as superordinate goals in earlier versions)
*   strategy
*   structure
*   system
*   style
*   staff
*   skills.

These seven elements are equally important and should be aligned and balanced, as seen in Figure 2.3.

![Image of Figure 2.3 shows McKinsey 7 S Framework diagram which describes the seven elements](Workforce%20and%20talent%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Picture3.png)

**Figure 2.3 The 7-S model**<sup><strong>5</strong></sup>

The elements of the model should be supported by the organization’s workforce and talent management practice , as outlined in Table 2.1.

#### Table 2.1 The elements of the 7-S model that are supported by the practice

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Element of the 7-S model</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Role of the workforce and talent management practice</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Shared values</p></td><td><p>To ensure that everyone in the organization shares the same goals, guiding principles, and values.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Strategy</p></td><td><p>To ensure a common approach to workforce and talent management, which is aligned with the organization’s overall strategy.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Structure</p></td><td><p>To establish and continually improve the organizational structure that supports the organization’s strategy and objectives.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>System</p></td><td><p>To adopt effective, efficient, reliable, and continually optimized workflows and tools for the management of the organization’s human resources.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Style</p></td><td><p>To nurture a culture that effectively supports an organization’s guiding principles, values, and objectives. This includes the employees’ and leaders’ style, values, and behaviour.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Staff</p></td><td><p>To ensure that there are enough of the right employees within the organization to be effective, and that their performance and workload are adequate.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Skills</p></td><td><p>To ensure that the people in the organization are qualified for their jobs, have the right expertise and skillsets and are competent enough to be able to support the organization’s current and future needs.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Shared values and the organization’s overall strategy are usually inputs into the workforce and talent management practice. They are articulated by the organization’s governing body and executive management. The workforce and talent management practice is used to ensure that the strategy is communicated and adopted across the organization and to external stakeholders.

The organizational structure, system of management, and culture (known as structure, system, and style in the 7-S model) are defined, developed, and continually improved mostly through this practice, in conjunction with other practices.

#### 2.2.3 Organizational structure forms

There are many organizational forms that are designed to optimize how human resources are positioned and managed to ensure optimal performance and strategic alignment. These forms aim to optimize solutions for the four universal problems of organizing:<sup>6</sup>

*   task division and allocation
*   integrated coordination
*   reward distribution
*   information provision.

The fundamental types of organizations are hierarchies, markets, and communities.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Key message</strong></td></tr><tr><td><ul><li>Hierarchical organizations are focused on the authority structure. They are oriented towards the owners’ objectives and the employees’ objectives and performance. Organizations tend to own the resources that they use. Formal agreements are typically employment contracts.</li><li>Market-like organizations are based on service relationships between members (such as divisions, partners, and employees). Members of an organization aim to achieve their own objectives; whereas an entire organization aims to balance value for its members. Every organizational member tends to own the resources that they use. Formal agreements are typically service contracts.</li></ul><ul><li>Community-based organizations focus on shared values, rules, and objectives. Resources are shared between organizational members. Entire organizations aim to balance the members’ contributions and value. Formal agreements are typically memberships.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

The most established traditional organizational forms are hierarchical. Thee are increasingly unsuited to the demands of the VUCA environments. Market and community forms (also known as network, virtual, intelligent, boundary-less, self-managing, or center-less) offer greater flexibility, efficiency, and a wider and quicker access to resources. However, these types are rarely seen in a pure form. Real-life organizational forms are hybrids of two or three of these types. Some examples of hybrid organizational forms are shown in Figure 2.4.

![Image of Figure 2.4 Figure shows examples of hybrid organizational forms](Workforce%20and%20talent%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Picture4.png)

**Figure 2.4 Examples of hybrid organizational forms**<sup><strong>7</strong></sup>

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definitions: Functional hierarchy</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A hierarchical structure, dividing the organization into departments based on its functions with multiple levels of hierarchy. The authority is centralized.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Multi-divisional</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A hierarchical structure, dividing the organization into divisions with significant levels of autonomy and responsibilities for achieving its objectives. However, the objectives and policies are set by a central authority. Divisions can be formed on a product, territory, market, or other basis.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Matrix</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A combination of two hierarchies (functional and product, functional and project, or others), with some authorities and responsibilities within every dimension of the matrix.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Clan organizational culture</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A family-like or tribe-like organizational form that emphasizes the consensus and commonality of objectives and values and is often combined with autocratic leadership.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Adhocracy</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A non-hierarchical, flexible, adaptable, and informal form of organization with a minimum formal structure. It usually includes several specialized multidisciplinary teams, for example a product or service-focused team.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Holacracy</strong></td></tr><tr><td>An organizational form in which authority and decision-making are distributed throughout a system of self-organizing teams of very similar rights, authority, and responsibilities.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Collaborative community</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A collaborative organizational form where independent members participate in the whole problem-solving process, with the community commonly playing an important integrating role.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Crowd contest</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A collaborative organizational form where independent members develop potential solutions to standalone problems and typically do not participate in selecting the winning contributions or integrating them into higher-level solutions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Online labour market</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>An organizational solution where organizations employ online labour market technology to facilitate the brokering of micro-tasks among internal employees and/or external service providers.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The adoption of a new organizational form requires large-scale transformation and cannot be performed overnight. The workforce and talent management practice plays a significant role in the organizational planning and implementation of a selected organizational form, in conjunction with other practices (such as the organizational change management, relationship management, strategy management, and project management practices, among others).

It is important that the organizational form is not the only consideration of organizational design, and that the form or structure of an organization helps the overall organization improve how it delivers products and services to consumers. It is important to consider the organization holistically, as described in section 2.2.2.

#### 2.2.4 Workforce management

The terminology of the workforce and talent management practice has evolved, adopting terms such as labour, human resources, personnel, human capital, and workforce to describe the people of an organization. ITIL uses the term workforce management to describe the practices that ensure that organizations have enough people in the right places, to fulfil the jobs required for achieving the organizations’ current and anticipated objectives. Organizations might use different terminology to describe the same practices, according to their cultural, social, and industrial context. For convenience, any member of a workforce is referred to as an employee in ITIL, regardless of how they engage with the organization. This definition will become especially important in understanding and managing the employee journey and employee satisfaction as defined in the following sections.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definition: Employee</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>Any individual engaged to work within an organization. This includes but is not limited to: permanent members of staff, contractors, volunteers, and members of another organization’s staff who are working under the organization’s authority. Also referred to as a ‘member of workforce’.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Workforce management is closely connected with organizational planning (see 2.2.3), talent management (see 2.2.5), and other practices, such as the capacity and performance management, organizational change management, and relationship management practices (see respective practice guides). It is also important to consider the supplier management practice and the organization’s sourcing strategy, which is likely to impact on the organization’s attitude towards workforce sourcing.

Workforce management includes:

*   ensuring that the organization has enough people to fulfil its plans and accommodate all necessary unplanned work
*   ensuring a good balance between the cost of the workforce and the value enabled by the workforce
*   ensuring a positive employee experience.

To achieve these goals, organizations must identify, manage, and continually optimize the employee journey for all people in the organization, whether they are permanent, temporary, or part of a partner or supplier’s staff working within the organization.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definitions: Employee journey</strong></td></tr><tr><td>The complete end-to-end experience that an employee has with the organization through touchpoints, relationships, and interactions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Employee experience</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>The total of the functional and emotional interactions with an organization as perceived by an employee.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The employee journey can be mapped using the service relationship journey model described in *ITIL 4*<sup><em>®</em></sup>*: Drive Stakeholder Value* and shown in Figure 2.5.

![Image of Figure 2.5 shows a diagram representing how the employee journey can be mapped using the service relationship journey model described in ITIL4](Workforce%20and%20talent%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Picture5.png)

  
**Figure 2.5 Service relationship journey model**

Table 2.2 describes the basic content of the interactions between an employee and an organization throughout the employee journey, either when applying for a new role within an organization or in moving to a new role or team within the organization.

#### Table 2.2 Employee journey steps

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Employee journey step</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Employee’s and/or team’s activities</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Organization’s activities</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Explore</p></td><td><ul><li>Understand the requirements and expectations from a job, role, or team</li><li>Look for vacancies and opportunities</li><li>Publish a CV or resumé</li><li>Use peer connections to collect information and attract attention</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Understand requirements and expectations from an employee or team</li><li>Look for candidates</li><li>Publish a vacancy description</li><li>Use internal and external recommendations to attract attention and identify candidates</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Engage</p></td><td><ul><li>Send a CV or resume to a selected organization(s)</li><li>Attend an interview</li><li>Discuss terms of work</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Contact selected employees and/or teams</li><li>Conduct interviews</li><li>Discuss terms of work</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Offer</p></td><td><p>Discuss the offer(s)</p></td><td><p>Make a job offer</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Agree</p></td><td><p>Sign work contract as needed</p></td><td><p>Sign work contract as needed</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Onboard</p></td><td><p>Get familiar with the organization, attend onboarding training and other activities, pass any required tests and exams</p></td><td><p>Provide training and awareness, familiarize the newcomer(s) with the organization</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Co-create</p></td><td><p>Work at the organization according to the contract or agreement and in line with the organization’s values and culture</p></td><td><p>Work with the employee and/or team according to the contract or agreement and in line with the declared organization’s values and culture</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Realize</p></td><td><ul><li>Provide feedback about the employee experience</li><li>Discuss and demonstrate performance</li><li>Participate in personal, team-specific, and organizational development planning</li><li>Review and adjust the work contract</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Employee performance</li><li>Process employee’s and/or team’s feedback</li><li>Discuss employee’s and/or team’s performance</li><li>Involve employees and teams in personal and organizational development planning</li><li>Review and adjust work contracts and agreements, organizational values, and culture</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

Table 2.2 describes the basic activities involved in each step of the employee journey in a generic way. The activities should be adjusted for different types of work relationships (permanent, temporary, volunteer, outsourced, and others) and for employee profiles, sometimes called employee personas. These tailored descriptions can be used as models for managing the employee journeys and improving the employee experience.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definitions:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><ul><span><strong>Employee persona</strong></span></ul>A fictional yet realistic description of a typical or target employee of an organization.<ul><li><strong>Employee journey model</strong></li></ul><p>A detailed description of the organization’s approach to the management of the employee journey, tailored for a specific employee persona.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The employee journey models typically include:

*   an employee persona description
*   possible positions in the organization
*   forms of employment
*   sources of candidates
*   the searching and recruiting approach
*   work contract terms
*   the negotiation approach
*   the onboarding approach
*   the performance management approach, including performance review and development planning
*   the training and development approach
*   the exception handling approach
*   the life events handling approach
*   the offboarding approach.

The employee journey models aim to ensure value co-creation for the organization and the employee by:

*   creating a positive employee experience
*   maintaining employee satisfaction, loyalty, and commitment
*   monitoring, maintaining, and continually improving employees competence.

The employee experience is created through the physical work environment, social interactions, work interactions, and the essence of work to be done. To improve the employee experience, organizations employ approaches such as personalization, transparency, simplicity, authenticity, and responsiveness[<sup>8</sup>](https://my.axelos.com/resource-hub/practice/workforce-and-talent-management-itil-4-practice-guide#_ftn1). The ITIL guiding principles can be helpful for this purpose, as shown in Table 2.3.

#### 2.2.5 Talent management

Talent management describes work that ensures organizations can meet current and forecasted requirements and that this is achieved in the most efficient way. It is sometimes called competency management or skills management. Organizations might use different terminology to describe the same practices, according to their cultural, social, and industrial context.

Talent management is focused on the competencies of employees, which includes knowledge and skills.

In its simplest and most widely adopted form, talent management considers the competencies of individual employees and small teams. Less commonly, an organization can adopt a holistic approach to understand and develop a competency pool of the whole organization. Other approaches to talent management include:

*   technical expertise only (hard skills) versus a holistic skill set (hard and soft skills)
*   formally recorded competencies versus implicit competence<sup>9</sup>
*   based on objectives versus based on competency models.<sup>10</sup>

These and other options are usually selected and defined by the organization’s workforce and talent management strategy, which is agreed as a part of the organizational design.

In ITIL, a simple model is used to identify the competencies required for specific activities in addition to technical knowledge and skills. The model defines five key competency profiles, as described in Table 2.4. It is important to note that these competencies describe the roles, activities, and/or skills of an individual or team and are not directly tied to titles or positions.

##### Table 2.4 Competency codes and profiles

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Competency code</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Competency profile (activities and skills)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>L</p></td><td><p><strong>Leader</strong> Decision-making, delegating, overseeing other activities, providing incentives and motivation, and evaluating outcomes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A</p></td><td><p><strong>Administrator</strong> Assigning and prioritizing tasks, record-keeping, ongoing reporting, and initiating basic improvements</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>C</p></td><td><p><strong>Coordinator/communicator</strong> Coordinating multiple parties, maintaining communication between stakeholders, and running awareness campaigns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>M</p></td><td><p><strong>Methods and techniques expert</strong> Designing and implementing work techniques, documenting procedures, consulting on processes, work analysis, and continual improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>T</p></td><td><p>Technical expert Providing technical (IT) expertise and conducting expertise-based assignments</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Every ITIL practice guide includes a competency profile for each practice’s activity. A competency profile includes one to five letters (L, A, C, M, T) in order of decreasing importance for that activity. For example, the code TMC suggests that the most important competencies for that activity are technical expertise, implementing methods and techniques, and coordination and communication skills, in order of importance. Leadership and administrative skills are not important for this activity.

An organization can use this model and recommendations from the ITIL practice guides to identify, assess, plan, and improve the competencies of employees. Organizations can also assign roles and responsibilities to better qualified employees and combine people to perform roles, when there are not any individuals available who possess a full skill set. The competency profiles for the workforce and talent management practice are provided in section 4.

Talent management is not limited to competency assessment and planning. It should also include active professional development through training, certification, job rotation and cross-training, and other techniques. Increasingly popular approaches include internal and external consulting, mentoring, and coaching for individual employees and teams. In Agile organizations, self-organized teams direct their own competency assessments, planning, and development. *ITIL® 4: Create, Deliver and Support* recommends creating T-shaped and comb-shaped resources to help individuals and teams learn skills beyond a single area of expertise and promote knowledge sharing, continual learning, and the removal of resource bottlenecks in delivering products and services to customers.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definitions:</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong></strong><span><strong>Consulting</strong></span></td></tr><tr><td>Helping people and organizations improve their performance by providing technical and professional advice based on the consultants’ significant understanding, knowledge, and experience. The relationship is usually limited to an agreed period of time to solve a specific problem.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mentoring</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A service relationship in which a more experienced or more knowledgeable person helps to guide a less experienced or less knowledgeable person. Mentors provide insight and guidance to their mentees when the latter encounters challenges in their professional journey. Mentors might have little expertise in their mentee’s subject matter field, but they generally understand how to navigate organizations.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Coaching</strong></td></tr><tr><td>A form of personal and/or professional development in which an experienced person, called a coach, supports an individual or team in achieving specific personal or professional goals by unlocking their potential and providing tools and techniques to inspire confidence. The aim of coaching is to transform and achieve better results, without directly advising or implementing ready-made solutions.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Self-organized team</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>A team that has the autonomy to choose how best to accomplish their work (including assessing, planning, and developing competencies), rather than being directed by others outside the team.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### 2.2.6 Culture

The organizational culture is an important part of an organization’s identity, image, and eventual success or failure.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definition: Culture</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>A set of values shared by a group of people, including expectations about how people should behave and their ideas, beliefs, and practices.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Culture maps are described in *ITIL® 4: Drive Stakeholder Value* as a useful tool for designing products and services for different audiences. Culture maps are also useful in organizational design, where organizations have significant cultural diversity. Figure 2.5 shows the culture of two groups of people mapped to eight dimensions to identify similarities and differences. In this figure, each dimension is represented as a spectrum of opposite extremes.<sup>11</sup>

![](Workforce%20and%20talent%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Picture1.1.png)

**Figure 2.5 Culture maps comparing similarities and differences**

The workforce and talent management practice, in conjunction with other practices (including the strategy management and relationship management practices, among others) ensures that the culture of an organization is based on shared and clearly articulated values and principles and that the cultural differences are effectively addressed. Organizations should embrace and inspire diversity, including cultural diversity and diversity in personal background.

#### 2.2.7 Conscious leadership

Leadership and leaders are an important driver of an organization’s success. Successful leaders embrace more than just an understanding of value and what makes a good vision and plan.

Good leadership competencies include:

*   emotional, social, and systems intelligence
*   cognitive flexibility
*   self-leadership
*   discerning thinking
*   complexity thinking
*   conversational intelligence, multimodal communication skills.

Effective leaders:

*   engage, inspire, and motivate people by behaving with integrity to generate respect and empower employees
*   focus on value by being prepared to reprioritize to stay aligned with the overall vision
*   create a healthy culture by consistently following the organization’s values
*   create and communicate a clear vision
*   show a commitment to knowledge and continual learning.

In a VUCA business environment, more organizations should adopt sustainable values that are supported by conscious leadership.

Conscious leadership balances the common global good and individual self-interests. This is leadership guided by a vision and driven by values that target not only the success of the organization but also the well-being of all stakeholders, including employees, customers, investors, partners, society, and the environment. Conscious leaders speak with integrity, lead with authenticity, and hold themselves accountable. They listen with the intent to understand and not just to respond, and they do it by being in tune with themselves and the world around them.<sup>12</sup> For additional details on digital leadership, refer to section 8 of the *ITIL® 4: Digital and IT Strategy.*

### 2.3 Scope

The workforce and talent management includes:

*   holistic organizational planning, including the organizational structure, culture, competencies, and other factors
*   managing and improving the organization’s identity and image
*   managing the organization’s workforce
*   managing the organization’s talents
*   managing and improving the employees’ journeys and experience
*   ensuring ongoing oversight of people’s roles, behaviours, and experiences in the organization.

There are some activities and areas of responsibility that are not included in the workforce and talent management practice, although they are still closely related to workforce and talent management. These are listed in Table 2.5, along with references to the practices in which they can be found. It is important to remember that ITIL practices are combined in the context of value streams to enable value creation.

#### Table 2.5 Activities related to the workforce and talent management described in other practice guides

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Activity</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Practice guide</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Managing organizational changes</p></td><td><p>Organizational change management</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Managing internal relationships as well as relationships with partners and consumers</p></td><td><p>Relationship management</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Managing project-specific training, onboarding, and other workforce-related projects</p></td><td><p>Project management</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Planning capacity and identifying demand for change in the number of employees</p></td><td><p>Capacity and performance management</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Identifying and managing people-related risks</p></td><td><p>Risk management</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Defining sourcing strategy, including sourcing of workforce</p></td><td><p>Supplier management</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

### 2.4 Practice success factors

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definition: Practice Success Factor</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>A complex functional component of a practice that is required for the practice to fulfil its purpose.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

A practice success factor (PSF) is more than a task or activity, as it includes components of all four dimensions of service management. The nature of the activities and resources of PSFs within a practice may differ, but together they ensure that the practice is effective.

The workforce and talent management practice includes the following PSFs:

*   ensuring the continual alignment of the workforce and talent management approach to the organization's business strategy
*   ensuring that motivated and competent people effectively contribute to the achievement of the organization's objectives
*   ensuring that the administrative processes for this practice effectively support the organization's strategy and objectives.

#### 2.4.1 Ensuring the continual alignment of the workforce and talent management approach to the organization's business strategy

Organizations’ strategies continually evolve. In a digital economy with high levels of volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity, organizations move from long-term, rigid, and detailed plans to an agile approach with goals that are continually redefined and adjusted based on the analysis of external and internal factors. (See more on this in the strategy management practice guide and *ITIL® 4: Digital and IT Strategy*).

To support these changes in strategy management, organizations must adopt an agile approach to organizational planning. This implies:

*   adopting organizational forms that are optimized for agility and efficiency
*   nurturing an organizational culture that is optimized for agility, creativity, and efficiency
*   inspiring and promoting servant leadership
*   planning for changes that are in demand in the organization’s workforce.

Organizations optimized for agility, evolution, and efficiency tend to demonstrate the following features:<sup>13</sup>

*   They scale-up by adopting small teams and flatter structures. The adoption of adaptable organization systems (such as holacracy, cells, network, and so on) allows organizations to expand or reduce without significant changes to its organizational structure. Organizations can also add new capabilities, experiment, and innovate.
*   They utilize a connected workforce. People working in different locations form effective teams, by using digital technologies to collaborate and communicate. This approach increases efficiency, velocity, and resilience. The wide adoption of remote working, including working from home, ensures continuity in times of disruption, such as environmental and social events.
*   Employees are encouraged to think like entrepreneurs. They should think and work holistically, focus on value, innovate, and voice their opinions. This increases the organization’s innovative potential, safety culture, and stimulates the individuals’ development and growth opportunities.
*   They focus on needs, rather than on formal requirements. Organizations should aim to enable value for stakeholders by addressing their wants and needs, not focusing solely on the customers’ articulated requirements. This improves the customer and user experience and stimulates the organization’s development. The essential principles for this feature are: focus on value, holistic thinking, and iterative progress based on feedback.
*   Agility and adaptability are key features of successful digital organizations. Successful organizations adopt and promote agile ways of planning, execution, and improvement. They continually adapt to the changing environment and the internal circumstances. This approach includes flexible planning, the adoption of Agile and Lean methods, optimizing for complexity, and experimentation.
*   They demonstrate creativity and innovation. Creative and innovative solutions improve the organization’s positioning, create competitive advantages, and optimize the internal methods of work. Techniques such as design thinking are widely adopted to support creativity and innovation.
*   They adopt emerging digital technology. Many of the features mentioned here are supported by digital technology. The most important features include: collaboration and communication solutions, cloud solutions, machine learning, and advanced analytics. The early adopters of these technologies often demonstrate better performance than their more conservative competitors.
*   They embrace and promote diversity. In a diverse world, diversity, inclusivity, and equality are not only the ethical choices of responsible organizations; they also ensure a diversity of cultures, backgrounds, and approaches. This helps organizations to: innovate, see opportunities, and understand and cater to diverse consumer groups and societies.
*   They embrace democratized learning and development. Organizations move from a directive long-term approach to learning and development, to a more democratic and flexible approach. This includes peer-to-peer consulting, coaching, and mentoring, and on-demand training, even if the topic is not directly linked to the employee’s work responsibilities. Organizations inspire employees to learn what is important and relevant to them and share knowledge by forming internal and external communities. Additional details on knowledge-sharing tools and techniques can be found in the knowledge management practice guide.
*   They embrace the triple bottom line approach, as well as sustainability. Organizations move from purely financial objectives and indicators to more holistic values, principles, and goals. The most common approach is the triple bottom line approach which consists of three parts: financial, societal, and environmental values and goals. This is also known as 3-P: people, profit, and planet, with all three Ps being equally important.

#### 2.4.2 Ensuring that motivated and competent people effectively contribute to the achievement of the organization's objectives

Ensuring that motivated and competent people effectively contribute to the achievement of the organization's objectives, depends on an effective workforce management practice (see 2.2.4) and talent management practice (See 2.2.5), in conjunction with other practices.

To ensure the realization of this PSF, organizations create and maintain effective approaches to:

*   the management of the employee journey
*   continual learning and development
*   maintaining a healthy organizational culture
*   conscious leadership.

By combining these approaches, organizations:

*   identify the organization’s needs in its workforce and competencies
*   ensure that the required workforce and competencies are available when needed
*   ensure that the people in the organization share the organization’s values, understand the objectives, and follow a shared set of principles
*   ensure that the people in the organization satisfy their needs for safety, autonomy, professional and personal development, and purposeful contribution
*   ensure that the physical, social, and work environment and interactions in the organization are optimized for the effective contribution to the organization’s objectives and aligned with the organizational culture and principles.

#### 2.4.3 Ensuring that the administrative processes for this practice effectively support the organization's strategy and objectives

The workforce and talent management practice includes an important administrative feature. Organizations need to understand how many teams and people they have and their workload, competencies, current and future availability, work performance, associated costs, and so on. This is important for the effective management of the workforce, and to ensure conformance to agreed rules and compliance to relevant regulations.

The workforce and talent management practice ensures the effective integration of the administrative procedures into the organization’s teams, practices, value streams, policies, processes, and procedures. The aim is to ensure a sufficient level of control, conformance, and compliance without excessive bureaucracy or a negative effect on performance and motivation.

To achieve this, it is recommended to follow the ITIL guiding principles, especially:

*   focus on value: introduce controls that clearly contribute to value creation for stakeholders
*   think and work holistically: analyse and optimize controls in the wider context of the organization and environment
*   progress iteratively with feedback: listen to feedback from employees and other stakeholders, optimize administrative procedures and controls following their requirements and suggestions
*   optimize and automate: many controls and communications can be effectively and conveniently automated to minimize extra efforts, associated costs, and distractions.

### 2.5 Key metrics

The effectiveness and performance of the ITIL practices should be assessed within the context of the value streams to which each practice contributes. As with the performance of any tool, the practice’s performance can only be assessed within the context of its application. However, tools can differ greatly in design and quality, and these differences define a tool’s potential or capability to be effective when used according to its purpose. Further guidance on metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other techniques that can help with this can be found in the measurement and reporting practice guide.

Key metrics for the workforce and talent management practice are mapped to its PSFs. They can be used as KPIs in the context of value streams to assess the contribution of the practice to the effectiveness and efficiency of those value streams. Some examples of key metrics are given in Table 2.6.

#### Table 2.6 Example of key metrics for the practice success factors

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Practice success factors</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Key metrics</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ensuring the continual alignment of the workforce and talent management approach to the organization's business strategy</p></td><td><ul><li>Number of strategic initiatives not supported or otherwise negatively impacted by this practice’s strategy, and the associated impact</li><li>Number and percentage of strategic objectives supported by the organizational strategy</li><li>Stakeholder (employees included) satisfaction with the organization’s approach to this practice</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ensuring that motivated and competent people effectively contribute to the achievement of the organization's objectives</p></td><td><ul><li>Number of plans and agreements negatively affected by lack of workforce and/or competence, and the associated impact</li><li>Number and cost of idle (not engaged in valuable activities) employees</li><li>Attrition rate</li><li>Employee satisfaction</li><li>Employer image/brand of the organization</li><li>Employee lifetime value and ROI on employees and/or teams</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ensuring that the administrative processes for this practice effectively support the organization's strategy and objectives</p></td><td><ul><li>Stakeholder satisfaction with the workforce and talent administration</li><li>Relevant audit findings and success in passing audits</li><li>Cost to value ratio of the administrative controls and procedures</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

The correct aggregation of metrics into complex indicators will make it easier to use the data for the ongoing management of value streams, and for the periodic assessment and continual improvement of the workforce and talent management practice. There is no single best solution. Metrics will be based on the overall service strategy and priorities of an organization, as well as on the goals of the value streams to which the practice contributes.

## 3. Value Streams and processes

### 3.1 Value stream contribution

Like any other ITIL management practice, the workforce and talent management practice contributes to multiple value streams. It is important to remember that a value stream is never formed from a single practice. The workforce and talent management practice combines with other practices to provide high-quality products and services to consumers. The main value chain activities to which the practice contributes are:

*   plan
*   design and transition
*   improve.

The contribution of the workforce and talent management practice to the service value chain is shown in Figure 3.1.

![Image of Figure 3.1 shows Heat map of the contribution of workforce and talent management process](Workforce%20and%20talent%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Picture7.png)

**Figure 3.1 Heat map of the contribution of the workforce and talent management practice to value chain activities**

### 3.2 Processes

Each practice may include one or more processes and activities that may be necessary to fulfil the purpose of that practice.

<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Definition: Process</strong></td></tr><tr><td><p>A set of interrelated or interacting activities that transform inputs into outputs. A process takes one or more defined inputs and turns them into outputs. Processes define the sequence of actions and their dependencies.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Workforce and talent management activities form three processes:

*   organizational planning
*   employees’ journey management
*   talent management.

#### 3.2.1 Organizational planning

This process is focused on defining and implementing an organization-wide approach and strategy for the workforce and talent management practice, and its continual maintenance in line with the organization’s evolution and changing direction.

This process includes the activities listed in Table 3.1 and transforms the inputs into outputs.

#### Table 3.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs of the *organizational planning* process

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Key inputs</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Activities</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Key outputs</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><ul><li>Organization’s principles, policies, and vision</li><li>Organization’s business strategy</li><li>Organization’s portfolios</li><li>External factors, including risks and opportunities</li><li>The workforce and talent management performance reports</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Strategic analysis</li><li>Service value chain analysis</li><li>Organizational design</li><li>Initiating and monitoring organizational changes</li><li>Organization monitoring and review</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Strategic and service value chain analysis reports</li><li>Organization’s workforce and talent management strategy, including organizational values, structure, and culture</li><li>The workforce and talent management guidelines</li><li>Organizational changes and improvement initiatives</li></ul><ul><li>The workforce and talent management performance reports</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### 3.2.2 Employees’ journey management

This process is focused on end-to-end employee journeys across the organization, from understanding the demand for the workforce, to offboarding. It describes universal activities that aim to ensure that all employee journeys are successful and relevant to the organization’s needs, and ensure a positive employee experience.

This process includes the activities listed in Table 3.3 and transforms the inputs into outputs.

#### Table 3.3 Inputs, activities, and outputs of the employees’ journey management process

## 4. Organizations and people

### 4.1 Roles, competencies, and responsibilities

The practice guides do not describe the practice management roles such as practice owner, practice lead, or practice coach. They focus instead on the specialist roles that are specific to each practice. The structure and naming of each role may differ from organization to organization, so any roles defined in ITIL should not be treated as mandatory, or even recommended. Remember, roles are not job titles. One person can take on multiple roles and one role can be assigned to multiple people.

Roles are described in the context of processes and activities. Each role is characterized with a competency profile based on the model shown in Table 4.1.

#### Table 4.1 Competency codes and profiles

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Competency code</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Competency profile (activities and skills)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>L</p></td><td><p><strong>Leader</strong> Decision making, delegating, overseeing other activities, providing incentives and motivation, and evaluating outcomes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>А</p></td><td><p><strong>Administrator</strong> Assigning and prioritizing tasks, record-keeping, ongoing reporting, and initiating basic improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>C</p></td><td><p><strong>Coordinator/communicator</strong> Coordinating multiple parties, maintaining communication between stakeholders, and running awareness campaigns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>М</p></td><td><p><strong>Methods and techniques expert</strong> Designing and implementing work techniques, documenting procedures, consulting on processes, work analysis, and continual improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Т</p></td><td><p><strong>Technical expert</strong> Providing technical (subject matter) expertise and conducting expertise-based assignments</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

#### 4.1.1 Human resource manager (HRM)

The key role specific to this practice is the HR manager. This role can be combined with the team manager role, depending on the practice’s scope, but it is more likely to be a dedicated job or even a team. The evolution of the practice and its role in organizations, has led to the evolution of the role of the HR manager.

The HR manager’s professionalism is based on:

*   core professional knowledge, usually obtained with relevant education
*   industry-specific knowledge, obtained with practice and supported by specialized training and certification, and with professional communities
*   organization-specific knowledge, obtained with practice and internal communities
*   professional code of ethics
*   knowledge of adjacent subject matter areas.

To keep their competencies relevant, HR professionals continually maintain their professional development and engage in professional communities, to share and exchange knowledge and experience.

The key competencies of an HR manager are similar to those of a successful leader and include:

*   emotional, social, and systems intelligence
*   cognitive flexibility
*   self-leadership
*   discerning thinking
*   complexity thinking
*   strategic thinking
*   conversational intelligence, multimodal communication skills
*   empathy and collaboration skills.

The responsibilities of an HR manager include all aspects of the workforce and talent management, as described in Table 4.2. The specific allocation of duties to professional HR managers, the organization’s leaders, and team managers is subject to the design of the workforce and talent management practice of the particular organization.

### 4.2 Organizational structures and teams

A specialized HR team is incorporated into the organization when they are develop the workforce and talent management practice. The positioning of the IT and HR teams might differ, depending on the role of technology and IT teams in the organization. Typical models include are explored in Table 4.3.

#### Table 4.3 Example positioning of HR teams towards IT teams

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Role of IT and IT team</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Positioning of HR team</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Role of HR and HR team in (IT) workforce and talent management</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>IT team acts as an internal service provider within a parent organization with relatively low IT dependency</p></td><td><p>HR team is focused on key business functions and teams of the organization, with only a minimum focus on IT teams</p></td><td><p>HR acts as a regulator and internal consultant, the majority of the workforce and talent management activities are performed by IT leaders and managers</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>IT team acts as an internal service provider within a parent organization with high IT dependency</p></td><td><p>HR team pays significant attention to IT as a key business enabler</p></td><td><p>There is a dedicated HR manager or team (often called HR business partner) supporting IT leaders and managers throughout the workforce and talent management processes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Organization is an IT service provider, digital technology is its key competency and area of business</p></td><td><p>HR team is created to support an IT-related business, digital technology is among the key competencies of the HR managers</p></td><td><p>HR team is specifically focused on workforce and talent management for the IT organization and works in close collaboration with IT leaders and managers</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The examples described in Table 4.3 are extremes, whereas real-life scenarios are usually more complex. It is important that this practice takes this positioning into account and develops the IT practice accordingly. An effective practice is not possible without close the cooperation, and preferably collaboration, between IT and HR leaders and managers.

## 5. Information and technology

### 5.1 Information exchange

The effectiveness of the workforce and talent management practice is based on the quality of the information used. This includes, but is not limited to, information about:

*   the organization’s strategy
*   the organization’s environment and key stakeholders
*   the organization’s portfolios: resources, products and services, and customers
*   the organization’s architectures
*   industry trends and opportunities
*   the labour market situation and trends
*   the workforce and talent management methods, tools, and techniques
*   the culture and climate of the organization
*   the ongoing performance of the organization

This information may take various forms. The key inputs and outputs of the practice are listed in section 3.

### 5.2. Automation and tooling

The automation of the practice is evolving, with technology becoming increasingly important. For example:

*   The utilization of machine learning and advanced analytics creates new opportunities for analysis, planning, and forecasting.
*   Communication and collaboration technologies enable new forms of learning and knowledge sharing.
*   Learning and content management systems make online training and collaboration easier and more efficient.
*   Technology connects organizations, creating a decentralized, organic community where market-based organizational forms are both possible and effective.

Table 5.1 lists the specific means of automation that are relevant to each activity of the workforce and talent management practice.

## 6. Partners and suppliers

Very few services are delivered using only an organization’s own resources. Most, if not all, depend on other services, often provided by third parties outside the organization (see section 2.4 of the *ITIL® Foundation: ITIL 4 Edition* publication for a model of a service relationship). This means that organizations work with employees from multiple organizations, with various levels of integration into the organization. Therefore, the term ‘employee’ as defined in section 2.2.4 as ‘any individual engaged to work within an. This includes, but is not limited to: permanent members of staff, contractors, volunteers, and members of another organization’s staff who are working under the organization’s authority’.

Organizations need to adjust their workforce and talent management practice to the sourcing model and overall architecture. This can be done by tailoring the employee journey models to different forms and terms of engagement (see sections 2.2.4, 2.4.2, and 3.2).

Where organizations aim to ensure an efficient and effective workforce and talent management practice, they usually try to cooperate more closely with their partners and suppliers, removing formal bureaucratic barriers in communication, collaboration, and decision-making. Refer to the ‘supplier management’ practice guide for more information on this topic. Additional details on when to ‘make versus buy’ products, services, or components; what to consider when outsourcing, and as well an overview on service models that can be used (that of a service guardian, single provider, retained service integration, or service-integration-as-a-service) are included in the *ITIL® 4: Create, Deliver and Support*.

Practice-specific roles and teams are described in sections 4.1.1 and 4.2; these are sometimes outsourced. However, this approach only proves to be effective for administrative activities. Strategic and tactical activities are usually too important and organization-specific to be outsourced. External consultants are often involved planning and assessing the workforce and talent, but the responsibility for the final decisions remains within the organization.

## 7. Important reminder

Most of the content of the practice guides should be taken as a suggestion of areas that an organization might consider when establishing and nurturing their own practices. The practice guides are catalogues of things that organizations might think about, not a list of answers. When using the content of the ITIL practice guides, organizations should always follow the ITIL guiding principles:

*   focus on value
*   start where you are
*   progress iteratively with feedback
*   collaborate and promote visibility
*   think and work holistically
*   keep it simple and practical
*   optimize and automate.

More information on the guiding principles and their application can be found in section 4.3 of *ITIL Foundation: ITIL 4 Edition.*
