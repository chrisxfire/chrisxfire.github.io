# 2. Overview
**Key Message**: The purpose of the supplier management practice is to ensure that the organization’s suppliers and their performances are managed appropriately to support the seamless provision of quality products and services. This includes creating closer, more collaborative relationships with key suppliers to uncover and realize new value and reduce the risk of failure.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Supplier management ensures effective use of third-party services by establishing a common approach to sourcing strategy and managing supplier relationships and by maintaining a single point of control over the active and planned supplier contracts and services.

The supplier management practice enables organizations to define strategies for the use of suppliers’ and partners’ services, to evaluate and select suppliers, and to ensure that consumed services meet or exceed agreed service levels, the cost of the consumed services is optimal, and associated risks are understood and controlled.

The sourcing strategy should support the overall organization’s strategy and define which of the organization’s resources should be created and managed internally and which may be obtained from and/or managed by third parties, and to what extent. It should also define the overall approach to managing third-party services; it can in turn be retained or delegated to a key supplier, or to a specialized service integrator. Policies and guidelines defined in the sourcing strategy have significant impact on the organization’s products and services, as well as on the organization’s structure and allocation of responsibilities. Regardless of the approach selected, no organization today is fully self-sufficient: every organization depends on third parties to some extent. Therefore, the supplier management practice is one of the key elements of overall success for the organization.

The supplier management practice ensures that the right supplier is evaluated and selected to deliver quality products and services that are aligned to the overall business objectives, essentially meeting the utility and warranty commitments. It ensures that suppliers enable the realization of the desired outcomes and meet or exceed the organization’s requirements for service and product quality, while minimizing the risks related to the delivery (in line with the overall risk appetite of the organization). Flexibility and agility are the key aspects of a modern organization and are also the key expectations from the suppliers.

The supplier management practice is used in close conjunction with other practices, including the relationship management, service level management, service financial management, risk management, and service configuration management practices.

## 2.2 Terms and concepts
<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong></strong><span><strong>Definition: Supplier</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A stakeholder responsible for providing services that are used by an organization.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

An engagement with a new supplier usually starts with assessing what suppliers are in the market and approaching them with a request for information, a quote, a proposal, a bid, or a demonstration (RfX).

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Definition: RfX</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>This umbrella term is used to reference to request for information (RFI), request for proposal (RFP), request for quote (RFQ), request for bid (RFB), or request for demonstration (RFD).</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

A relationship with a new or existing supplier is generally defined by the contract that the organization has with them.

The contract typically includes the service level agreement between the organization and supplier, covering the utility and warranty aspects of the services, terms and conditions, and payment schedules. It details the parties’ commitments, including responsibilities and deliverables, the parameters that are to be used to measure the supplier’s performance, and related reward or penalty attributes.

### 2.2.1 Supplier evaluation and supplier performance
Contracting a supplier happens as a result of supplier evaluation and selection. To evaluate a potential supplier and consequently assess its performance, an organization must have a supplier assessment framework.

Before suppliers are selected to deliver products or services, they are evaluated based on several factors. Organizations must brief the suppliers on the evaluation process and criteria.

Organizations may have different approaches for different suppliers, depending on the type of relationship and level of trust. However, all suppliers must be evaluated and assessed for their performance and value realization.

The suppliers must be appraised against defined performance targets to assess their effectiveness. These performance targets usually include the utility and warranty aspects and metrics related to the co-creation of value. Organizations must brief the suppliers on the criteria and the scoring process in advance.

## 2.3 Scope
The supplier management practice focuses on three key aspects:
* evaluating, selecting, and onboarding suppliers, and maintaining of their information in the supplier management information systems
* negotiating of contracts and ensuring that suppliers adhere to them, meeting all contractual obligations and deliverables and managing the contracts through their lifecycle
* measuring, tracking, and reporting on supplier performance and triggering the reward or penalty aspects of the contract, ensuring that the organization obtains value for money from the contracts.

The scope of the supplier management practice includes:
* enforcing the supplier management policy
* creating and maintaining the supplier selection and performance evaluation criteria and procedures
* establishing and maintaining the sourcing strategy and supplier categorization standards in accordance with the sourcing strategy
* defining of sourcing requirements and evaluation parameters for supplier selection
* creating and maintaining standard contract terms and conditions
* evaluating and selecting suppliers
* developing, negotiating, and agreeing contracts
* reviewing, renewing, and terminating contracts
* auditing the suppliers’ adherence to the contract
* measuring and reporting on supplier performance
* creating, maintaining, and using supplier onboarding and offboarding procedures
* creating and maintaining supplier performance measurement criteria
* collaborating and resolving conflicts with suppliers
* maintaining the data in supplier management information systems
* categorizing suppliers and managing risk
* identifying, tracking, and reporting on continual improvement measures related to the supplier management practice or suppliers.

There are several activities and areas of responsibility that are not included in the supplier management practice, although they are still closely related to supplier management. These are listed in Table 2.1, along with references to the practices in which they can be found. It is important to remember that ITIL practices are merely collections of tools to use in the context of value streams; they should be combined as necessary, depending on the situation.

## 2.4 Practice success factors
<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong></strong><span><strong>Definition: Practice success factor</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A complex functional component of a practice that is required for the practice to fulfil its purpose.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

A practice success factor (PSF) is more than a task or activity, as it includes components of all four dimensions of service management. The nature of the activities and resources of PSFs within a practice may differ, but together they ensure that the practice is effective.

The supplier management practice includes the following PSFs:
* ensuring that the sourcing strategy and guidelines effectively support the organization’s strategy
* ensuring that service relationships with all suppliers and partners are managed effectively and in line with internal and external regulations
* ensuring the effective integration of third-party services into the organization’s products and services.

#### 2.4.1 Ensuring that the sourcing strategy and guidelines effectively support the organization’s strategy
As part of strategy management, organizations define their sourcing policy, including principles and criteria for sourcing resources. According to this policy, a sourcing strategy is developed and maintained to ensure the alignment of the business needs and supplier targets. Apart from the sourcing principles and criteria, it includes supplier categorization, requirements for suppliers of each category, and basic rules of supplier relationship management.

The sourcing strategy is supported with guidelines covering key aspects of the practice, including:
* the management of the service relationship at every step of the service journey
* the management of contracts and agreements with suppliers
* supplier performance management and reporting
* the integration of third-party services into the organization’s products and services.

Organizations need to have the right procedures to identify suppliers as potential sourcing partners and categorize them based on the sourcing strategy. These procedures establish a framework to drive contractual compliance by suppliers, conduct periodic audits, and measure, analyze, review, and report on the performance of each supplier. This forms the key input for the supplier reviews and for the organizations to reward or penalize suppliers based on their performance.

Organizations should be able to effectively formulate contracts and agreements, evaluate and negotiate contract terms, and review contracts for renewal and/or termination.

The contractual compliance and supplier performance can be measured in terms of: contract adherence, SLA performance, compliance, innovation and improvement commitments, resourcing commitments, and value co-creation.

Managing suppliers involves ensuring that contracts are cost effective and provide value for money. This can be measured in terms of the year-on-year benefit or the potential value (financial saving, innovation, transformation, and so on) that suppliers bring as part of their offering.

#### 2.4.2 Ensuring that service relationships with all suppliers and partners are managed effectively and in line with internal and external regulations
Every organization acts as a service provider and as a service consumer. Service relationships with suppliers follow the same journey as service relationships with the organization’s service consumers, although the journey is perceived from the other side. The service relationship journey steps are shown in Figure 2.1 (see section 1.2 of *ITIL*<sup><em>®</em></sup> *4: Drive Stakeholder Value* for more details on the service relationship journey).

![Figure 2.1 The service relationship journey](Supplier%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Figure_2.1.png)

When organizations act as the service consumer, they follow the customer’s side of the journey, and suppliers follow the service provider’s side. Each step of the journey should be supported with procedures, skills and competencies, information, and tools; sometimes external services are used too. Many of these are considered part of the supplier management practice, but input from and the involvement of other practices is needed at every step, as is shown in Table 2.2.  

### Table 2.2 Examples of how the supplier management practice enables the service relationship journey
<table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>Processes and value streams</strong></td><td><strong>Organizations and people</strong></td><td><strong>Information and technology</strong></td><td><strong>Partners and suppliers</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Explore</strong></td><td>Procedures for search and shortlisting of suppliers</td><td>Skills and experience in procurement<p><span><span>Specialized roles and teams</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p></td><td>Access to external and internal information about suppliers<p>Information systems for procurement</p></td><td>Agent services in searching and vetting potential suppliers</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Engage</strong></td><td>Procedures for assessment, scanning, and vetting suppliers</td><td>Skills and experience in procurement<p>Specialized roles and teams</p></td><td>Information systems for procurement</td><td><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Offer</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Agree</strong></td><td>Procedures for drafting, negotiating and improving contracts and agreements</td><td>Negotiation<p>Legal and contract management skills</p><p>Specialized roles and teams</p></td><td>Information systems to manage contracts and agreements</td><td><strong></strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Onboard/offboard</strong></td><td>Procedures for the management of supplier onboarding, including effective integration with other practices</td><td>Skills and knowledge for supplier onboarding</td><td>Integration of the supplier’s services with the organization’s information systems, tools, and products</td><td>External integration services, where appropriate</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Co-create</strong></td><td>Procedures for performance management<br>Conflict resolution<br>Collaboration and ongoing interactions</td><td>Skills and knowledge for review and negotiation<br>Monitoring and reporting skills<br>Conflict management</td><td>Tools to collect and analyze data about performance of the services consumed<br>Service reporting systems<br>Conflict logging and resolution tools</td><td>External control of the services provided<br>Supplier audit, where appropriate</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Realize</strong></td><td>Procedures for third-party service evaluation and improvement initiation</td><td>Skills and knowledge for review and negotiation<br>Reporting and management of improvements</td><td>Reporting tools and improvement management tools</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

Specific solutions for every step vary depending on factors such as scale, type of service relationship, category of supplier(s), nature of the services they provide, and so on. Therefore, the supplier management practice should ensure the effective management of service relationships with all suppliers.

There are different approaches to establish supplier relationships based on the type of relationship required: basic, cooperative, or partnership. The relationship is dictated by the dependency that the organization has on the supplier or the need for strategic alignment.

In cooperative and partnership service relationships, organizations need to create and maintain a closer relationship with and between suppliers so that products are supported and services are provided seamlessly; they have means to address any conflict that can potentially arise between suppliers during product or service delivery. The supplier management practice ensures the effectiveness of supplier collaboration and conflict resolution, which can be measured in terms of clarity of collaboration clauses, supplier coordination, conflict handling, human resources, funding and knowledge contribution (or deficiency) by suppliers, and cultural dimensions.

Also, depending on the type of service relationship, the supplier performance measurement parameters need to be clearly articulated to ensure the right level of visibility into supplier performance. Supplier performance measurement parameters include parameters related to warranty, financial savings or returns, improvement or innovations, proactive initiatives, and collaboration. In a basic relationship, supplier performance measures are restricted to warranty parameters: in a cooperative relationship, they would include all parameters except that for innovation.

### 2.4.3 Ensure the effective integration of third-party services into the organization’s products and services
Third-party services form an important part of resources that organizations manage in order to create and deliver their products and services. Depending on the sourcing strategy, the level of integration of third-party services into organizations may vary, but most organizations have critical dependencies where core products and services may become unavailable in case of a major disruption of some of external services. The following is critical to effectively manage external services in the organization’s context:
* understanding the external service’s scope, nature, and terms of provision
* understanding the dependencies
* understanding the risks
* considering the dependencies and associated risks from the early steps of product design and along the product and service lifecycle.

To ensure these, the supplier management practice should be used in conjunction with other practices, including the architecture management, risk management, service design, business analysis, service configuration management, and service financial management practices.

At the operational level, the supplier management practice should support value streams dealing with third-party services and components; it is likely that the majority of organization’s value streams will need supplier management.

The onboarding and offboarding of suppliers must be done with the right procedures and an accurate means to capture or update the supplier dependency matrix, in alignment with the service relationship type. This is needed to seamlessly support the provisioning of continuous quality products and services to the business, especially during the period of supplier transition. This can be measured in terms of timeliness and effectiveness of the supplier onboarding and offboarding processes and procedures, and the accuracy of the supplier dependency matrix.

## 2.5 Key Metrics
The effectiveness and performance of the ITIL practices should be assessed within the context of the value streams to which each practice contributes. As with the performance of any tool, the practice’s performance can only be assessed in the context of its application. However, tools can differ greatly in design and quality, and these differences define a tool’s potential or capability to be effective when used according to its purpose. Further guidance on metrics, key performance indicators (KPIs), and other techniques that can help with this can be found in the measurement and reporting practice guide.

Key metrics for the supplier management practice are mapped to its PSFs. They can be used as KPIs in the context of value streams to assess the contribution of the supplier management practice to the effectiveness and efficiency of those value streams. Some examples of key metrics are given in Table 2.3.

### **Table 2.3 Examples of key metrics for the practice success factors**
<table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Practice success factors</strong></td><td><strong>Key metrics</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Ensuring that the sourcing strategy and guidelines effectively support the organization’s strategy</td><td>Number and impact of cases where strategic objectives could not be achieved due to dependencies on third parties<br>Number of strategic objectives not supported by the sourcing strategy<br>Number of sourcing strategy objectives that are not linked to the organization's strategy</td></tr><tr><td>Ensuring that service relationships with all suppliers and partners are managed effectively and in line with internal and external regulations</td><td>Stakeholders' satisfaction with the organization's relationships with third parties<br>Number and impact of breaches to relevant internal and external regulations<br>Realized value from relationships with suppliers and partners, including benefits, risks, and costs</td></tr><tr><td>Ensuring the effective integration of third-party services into the organization’s products and services</td><td>Stakeholders' satisfaction with third parties' integration into organization's value streams<br>Number and impact of losses, delays, and other forms of waste within organization's value stream caused by ineffective third-party integration<br>Number of incidents and SLA breaches associated with third-party participation in the organization's value streams</td></tr></tbody></table>

The correct aggregation of metrics into complex indicators will make it easier to use the data for the ongoing management of value streams, and for the periodic assessment and continual improvement of the supplier management practice. There is no single best solution. Metrics will be based on the overall service strategy and priorities of an organization, as well as on the goals of the value streams to which the practice contributes. 

# 3. Value Streams and processes
## 3.1 Value stream contribution
Like any other ITIL management practice, the supplier management practice contributes to multiple value streams. It is important to remember that a value stream is never formed from a single practice. The supplier management practice combines with other practices to provide high-quality services to consumers. The main value chain activities to which the practice contributes are:
* engage
* design and transition
* deliver and support
* improve
* obtain/build
* plan.

The contribution of the supplier management practice to the service value chain is shown in Figure 3.1.

![Image of Figure 3.1 shows Heat map of the contribution of the Supplier Management practice to Value Chain activities](Supplier%20management%20ITIL%204%20Practice%20Guide/Picture1.png)

**Figure 3.1 Heat map of the contribution of the supplier management practice to value chain activities**

## 3.2 Processes
Each practice may include one or more processes and activities that may be necessary to fulfil the purpose of that practice.

<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong></strong><span><strong>Definition: Process</strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A set of interrelated or interacting activities that transform inputs into outputs. A process takes one or more defined inputs and turns them into defined outputs. Processes define the sequence of actions and their dependencies.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

The supplier management practice activities form two main processes:
* managing a common approach to supplier management
* managing supplier journeys.

### 3.2.1 Managing a common approach to supplier management
This process is focused on defining, agreeing, and promoting an organization-wide approach to managing suppliers. It includes the activities listed in Table 3.1 and transforms the inputs into outputs.

### Table 3.1 Inputs, activities, and outputs of the managing a common approach to supplier management process

Some organizations where the duties of supplier selection and operational management of suppliers are segregated can also define an empanelment procedure. Empanelment can run as an independent exercise or through the RFI. The supplier empanelment procedure covers the conditions and requirements for empanelment and the empanelment workflow.</li><li>Supplier evaluation and selection: this defines how to evaluate suppliers during the selection process. The criteria describing supplier impact and importance, risks associated with the supplier, and costs and value offering can be used to score the suppliers. Each of the criteria can be scored based on a simple score or weighted score. In addition to the technical proposition, the evaluation parameters include the supplier’s service delivery track record, capability and references aligned to the services being outsourced. Additionally, the credit rating and organization’s size may be the other parameters to be considered during evaluation.</li><li>Supplier contracting: this defines the steps to be followed during the negotiation, formulation, maintenance, and management of contracts. The structure for various types of contracts covering basic, cooperating, and partnership service relationship types needs to be documented. Contract frameworks acts as a model for all contracts related to the type of service and service relationship. The procedure for the maintenance and management of contracts covers the contractual compliance and audit guidance, periodicity of such audits and corresponding actions for non-compliance and the review process. It also provides guidance related to:<ul><li>requirements for contract amendment</li><li>contract renewal</li><li>contract termination</li><li>contract expiration.</li></ul></li><li>Supplier onboarding and offboarding: this defines how suppliers are onboarded and enabled to provide services in organization’s cultural, financial, and operational context. These procedures should also include enabling users and stakeholders to consume suppliers’ services.</li></ul><p>These procedures should include service integration to coordinate or orchestrate all the suppliers involved in the development and delivery of products and services. Service integration builds a supplier into the end-to-end provision of services, ensuring control of all interfaces and outcomes from suppliers, and facilitating collaboration between suppliers. Procedures should define how the suppliers are offboarded and how access, dependencies, changes to service integration, non-disclosures, and risks and compliance issues are handled.</p><ul><li>Managing consumption and monitoring supplier performance: this defines how the organization manages the ongoing service delivery by suppliers and service interactions. This includes procedures for managing stakeholder satisfaction, maximizing the value of the service consumption, decreasing the costs connected with service consumption, managing risks and compliance, improving collaboration and the service mindset, resolving conflicts, and service exceptions. Supplier performance monitoring, assessment, and review is an evaluation criteria that will be used for the ongoing monitoring of supplier performance, methods of monitoring and value realization assessment techniques, reporting procedures, exceptions handling, continual improvement, and periodic reviews.</li><li>Supplier assessment and review: this defines the value realization assessment techniques, reporting procedures, exceptions handling, continual improvement, and periodic reviews.</li><li>Managing supplier governance, risk, and compliance throughout the supplier journey: supplier risk management procedures must be created, outlining initial risk reviews and due diligence of the potential suppliers, ongoing risk management, monitoring compliance, and running supplier audits, metrics, and KPIs. The key aspect here is the design of the governance organization that steers the<strong> </strong>way suppliers’ risks and compliance are to be managed and suppliers governed. Therefore, the governance body for supplier management might be established based on the organization’s size, supplier ecosystem, and requirements. Such a body would be focusing on managing and governing:</li><li>supplier risks</li><li>cross-supplier collaboration and service integration</li><li>contractual adherence</li><li>compliance</li><li>supplier audits.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Communicate and embed the sourcing strategy and procedures</strong></p></td><td><p>The agreed strategy and procedures are communicated and discussed with the supplier management stakeholders across the organization.

It is a master services agreement covering the terms and conditions, performance baselines and expectations, and reward and penalty mechanisms.</p><p>On the other hand, there may be a need to amend an existing contract, which may be trigged as a result of:</p><ul><li>dependency on a new contract being framed</li><li>requirement changes in an existing contract</li><li>technological changes</li><li>mergers and acquisitions or spin-offs</li><li>new services or changes to an existing service</li><li>performance levels achieved during the contract review period</li><li>new performance metrics and measurement methodologies to be introduced.</li></ul><p>In the case of multi-supplier environment, suppliers collaborating towards realizing the common end objective of the business is critical and is also a key element towards value co-creation. Therefore, the new contract or an amendment can have the set of collaboration or service integration clauses directed at ensuring that suppliers are accountable for collaborating with each other or agreeing to the existing service integration structure. This is especially important for cooperative and partnership relationship types.</p><p>After the contract or the amendment is finalized, it is signed by the signing authority of the parties involved. Once the contract is signed, the overall execution, monitoring, and management of the contract is performed by the contracts manager. This is an ongoing activity during the entire lifecycle of the contract.</p><p>If the organization takes a decision to not continue with the supplier’s services, then it results in contract termination. This may be due to supplier’s performance not being in-line with the organizations’ expectations, supplier consolidation, mergers and acquisitions, or other reasons that may result in a need to discontinue the supplier’s services. The supplier manager initiates the termination of the contract and the contracts manager terminates the contract as needed. Generally, in cases where the services are being retired and are no longer needed, a contract may be allowed to expire.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>On/offboarding suppliers</p></td><td><p>The requirement for a new supplier and/or supplier’s services to be onboarded or offboarded is registered by the supplier on/offboarding coordinator under the direction from the supplier manager. The onboarding and/or offboarding requirements may cover the services and sub-services, supplier’s processes and tools, and supplier’s team members. The onboarding and/or the offboarding plan is created along with the cutover plan leading to the go-live of (or switch to) new supplier services. Also, associated risks are identified, documented, and tracked as part of the risk register.</p><p>It is important that the supplier dependency mapping of services to the service providers and to the contracts is updated with the new supplier and/or service details or with the details of the supplier and/or services being offboarded.</p><p>When onboarding a supplier, the organization’s resources that the supplier will have access to must be detailed. The supplier manager or a sourcing team member (for example, the supplier on/offboarding coordinator) ensures that these activities are performed. The supplier team members are onboarded and required access provided. The supplier onboarding coordinator ensures that the service catalogue is updated with:</p><ul><li>new services</li><li>the mapping of services to the supplier and appropriate supplier teams.</li></ul><p>Also, as part of onboarding, the sourcing team categorizes the supplier based on their relevant importance to the organization, which depends on the service relationship and the associated risks. Therefore, the categorization ensures that the time spent on managing the suppliers is in line with their significance in the supplier ecosystem.</p><p>It is important to remember that, along with the supplier onboarding, the organization runs user onboarding and enablement, but this is out of scope of this practice.</p><p>As part of supplier offboarding, the supplier offboarding coordinator identifies the organization’s resources that supplier was leveraging, as well as their integration.</p><p>During offboarding, the following activities are performed:</p><ul><li>the organization's access to supplier's resources is revoked</li><li>the supplier's access to the organization's resources is revoked</li><li>all relevant people are made aware of the offboarding.</li></ul><p>These activities are completed in accordance with the supplier offboarding procedure and are tracked by the offboarding coordinator or other appointed sourcing team member.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Managing consumption and monitoring supplier performance</p></td><td><p>After the supplier is onboarded, the organization must ensure effective and efficient service consumption by following procedures defined by the sourcing strategy, including procedures for managing stakeholder satisfaction, maximizing the value of the service consumption, decreasing costs connected with service consumption, managing risks and compliance, improving collaboration and the service mindset, resolving conflicts, service exceptions, and contract deviations, and ensuring effective supplier monitoring.</p><p>Rating the supplier based on their performance is a key for effective service delivery, especially in the multi-supplier ecosystem that is prevalent in nearly every organization today. Therefore, defining the criteria based on which the supplier performance would be measured, forms a critical aspect of supplier management. With the digital enterprises and new generation delivery models like bi-modal IT, DevOps, and so on, the importance of a multi-facet supplier measurement system becomes even more important.</p><p>Performance measurement criteria include performance KPIs and related metrics, expected performance, measurement methodology for each KPI, and the way the performance would be reported. This includes reports, dashboards, and supplier scorecards.</p><p>Once the supplier performance criteria are implemented and operationalized, a team member is responsible for monitoring the supplier and the supplier’s performance. As part of this activity, the team collects the performance metrics and creates, and publishes the supplier performance reports, dashboards, and scorecards.</p><p>Businesses need to be protected from poor supplier performance or disruption; for example, the availability of services does not need to be compromised due to supplier performance. Organizations should establish the appropriate structure and governance to drive contractual compliance by suppliers, conduct periodic audits, and measure, analyze, review, and report on the performance of each supplier. This forms the key input to the organizations to reward or penalize suppliers based on their performance.</p><p>Supplier performance reports and scorecards serve as an input into periodic supplier reviews.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Assess and review the suppliers</p></td><td><p>Based on the reports from supplier monitoring and other related service consumption data, supplier value realization assessments are made.

# 4. Organizations and people
### 4.1 Roles, competencies, and responsibilities
The practice guides do not describe the practice management roles such as practice owners, practice lead, or practice coach. They instead focus on the specialist roles that are specific to each practice. The structure and naming of each role may differ from organization to organization, so any roles defined in ITIL should not be treated as mandatory, or even recommended. Remember, roles are not job titles. One person can take on multiple roles and one role can be assigned to multiple people.

Roles are described in the context of processes and activities. Each role is characterized with a competency profile based on the model shown in Table 4.1.

### Table 4.1 Competency codes and profiles
<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Competency code</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Competency profile (activities and skills)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>L</p></td><td><p><strong>Leader</strong>. Decision-making, delegating, overseeing other activities, providing incentives and motivation, and evaluating outcomes</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>A</p></td><td><p><strong>Administrator</strong>. Assigning and prioritizing tasks, record-keeping, ongoing reporting, and initiating basic improvements</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>C</p></td><td><p><strong>Coordinator/communicator</strong>. Coordinating multiple parties, maintaining communication between stakeholders, and running awareness campaigns</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>M</p></td><td><p><strong>Methods and techniques expert</strong>. Designing and implementing work techniques, documenting procedures, consulting on processes, work analysis, and continual improvement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>T</p></td><td><p><strong>Technical expert</strong>. Providing technical (IT) expertise and conducting expertise-based assignments.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

Two practice-specific roles may be found in organizations: supplier manager and supplier coordinator. These roles are often introduced in organizations where the number of suppliers and contracts to manage is high. These roles can be combined or separated depending on the organizational structure and amount of supplier management work.

### 4.1.1 Supplier manager
The supplier manager is typically responsible for:
* gathering business requirements for outsourcing or seeking products or services
* approving prerequisites for supplier selection
* involving intermediaries for creating RfXs and/or managing the RfX process
* categorizing suppliers based on their importance to the organization
* approving RfX-sent suppliers

* designing and instituting governance and compliance organizational and conflict-resolving procedures
* chairing and conducting governance and compliance and supplier review meetings
* ensuring the inclusion of clauses related to conflict resolving as part of the contract
* providing decisions on conflicts, rewards, penalties, and exceptions
* defining, agreeing, and implementing supplier performance criteria
* contributing towards performance clauses during contract or amendment creation
* monitoring supplier performance and publishing supplier reports, dashboards, and scorecards
* providing recommendations for performance appreciation, rewards, and penalties
* providing inputs for contract review, renewal, and/or termination
* orchestrating contracts finalization and required approvals.

### 4.1.2 Supplier coordinator
The supplier coordinator is typically responsible for:
* formulating prerequisites for supplier selection
* collating business requirements for RfXs
* releasing RfXs to suppliers and communicating the updates related to the selection process and eventual decisions to the suppliers
* coordinating with various stakeholders and assisting the supplier manager during the RfX process
* maintain supplier information in supplier management tools
* drafting and publishing agenda for the governance and compliance, supplier review meetings, and relevant information/details
* documenting and publishing minutes of governance and compliance and supplier review meetings
* preparing performance reports and details of pending actions and the exception requests
* keeping a supplier risk register
* creating or maintaining a supplier dependency matrix along with the mapping of tools
* onboarding and offboarding suppliers, people, process, services, and tools
* feeding updates to the service catalogue
* tracking progress of knowledge acquisition, knowledge transfer, and training
* ascertaining that delivery risks are appropriately captured during supplier onboarding and offboarding
* ensuring that the access to supplier team members are invoked or revoked as applicable
* recovering assets assigned to or managed by supplier team members
* transferring licenses from suppliers, if applicable
* publishing on/offboarding statuses and reports
* monitoring and auditing adherence to contracts
* capturing requirements for new contracts or amendments
* making decisions on contract renewal, termination, or expiration and ensuring timely review and renewal or termination of contracts.

Examples of other roles which can be involved in the supplier management activities are listed in Table 4.2, together with the associated competency profiles and specific skills.

## 4.2 Organizational structures and teams
It is unusual to see a dedicated organizational structure for the supplier management practice. Typically, the supplier manager and coordinator roles are associated with a formal job title under the supplier, vendor, or procurement management function, while the contract manager role is often associated with the legal function. Some organizations create committees (service committee, service quality committees, supplier governance committees, procurement committees, and so on) to address the strategic and tactical aspects of service performance and supplier governance.

# 5. Information and technology
## 5.1 Information exchange
The effectiveness of the supplier management practice is based on the quality of the information used. This information includes, but is not limited to, information about:
* customers and users
* services and their mapping to suppliers
* the organization’s requirements for the services and service dependencies
* existing partners and suppliers, including contract, SLA, and KPI information on the services they provide
* policies and requirements which regulate supplier management, supplier on/offboarding, supplier collaboration, contract formulation and governance, and conflict resolving and performance management
* improvement initiatives by suppliers and related value realization
* on/offboarding status, contract adherence, supplier performance, and conflicts
* stakeholder satisfaction with the suppliers
* market state and trends, emerging technologies, services, and suppliers.

This information may take various forms. The key inputs and outputs of the practice are listed in section 3.

## 5.2 Automation and tooling
In most cases, the supplier management practice can significantly benefit from automation. Where this is possible and effective, it may involve the solutions outlined in Table 5.1.

### Table 5.1 **Automation solutions for supplier management activities**

# 6. Partners and suppliers
Very few services are delivered using only an organization’s own resources. Most, if not all, depend on other services, often provided by third parties outside the organization (see section 2.4 of *ITIL Foundation: ITIL 4 Edition* for a model of a service relationship). Relationships and dependencies introduced by supporting services are described in the practice guides for portfolio management, service financial management, information security management, service continuity management, and service level management. Information about dependencies on third-party services is used in supplier management as part of requirements for the sourcing of partners and suppliers, evaluation of partners and suppliers, contract negotiation, and contract formulation.

The supplier management practice enables the evaluation, selection, and sourcing of the suppliers and partners supporting the organization’s requirement for services. Therefore, it cannot be outsourced. However, some activities of supplier management may be delegated in certain cases, as shown in Table 6.1.

### **Table 6.1 Outsourcing of supplier management activities**
<table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Activity</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Outsourcing opportunities</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Definition of requirements and drafting of requirements documents</p></td><td><p>A third party may act as an agent to collect the requirements and draft the requirement documents on behalf of the IT organization</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Manage supplier selection process</p></td><td><p>A third party may act as an agent for day-to-day operational coordination with potential supplier and partners participating in the selection process</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Supplier and partner response evaluation and selection</p></td><td><p>A third party may act as an agent to do the initial evaluation of supplier response and thus assist in supplier and partner selection</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Contract drafting and negotiation</p></td><td><p>A third party may act as an agent to assist in drafting the contract as well as assist in contract negotiation</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Contract and performance audits</p></td><td><p>A third party may act as an agent to do an independent audit to measure and report on contractual compliance and performance of contracted suppliers and partners</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

# 7. Important reminder
Most of the content of the practice guides should be taken as a suggestion of areas that an organization might consider when establishing and nurturing their own practices. The practice guides are catalogues of topics that organizations might think about, not a list of answers. When using the content of the practice guides, organizations should always follow the ITIL guiding principles:
* focus on value
* start where you are
* progress iteratively with feedback
* collaborate and promote visibility
* think and work holistically
* keep it simple and practical
* optimize and automate.

More information on the guiding principles and their application can be found in section 4.3 of *ITIL Foundation: ITIL 4 Edition*.
