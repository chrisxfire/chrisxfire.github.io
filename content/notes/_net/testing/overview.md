# Abstract [[Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/)]  

.NET supports various testing paradigms.

# types of tests
* Unit tests — test individual components or methods ("units of work"). They only test code within the developer's control and not infrastructure.
* Integration tests — tests two or more components' ability to function together (their "integration").
* Load tests — tests whether a system can handle a specified load.

# testing frameworks
* xUnit — free; open-source; a project of the .NET Foundation.
* NUnit — ported from JUnit; a project of the .NET Foundation.
* MSTest — Microsoft's test framework for all .NET languages.
