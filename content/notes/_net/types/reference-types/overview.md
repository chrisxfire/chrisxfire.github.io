# Reference Types
- Reference types store on the heap.
- The default value for reference types is null.
- All reference types support inheritance.

`object` (`System.Object`)  
`string` (`System.String`)  

## dynamic (`System.Object`)
Functions like Type `object`.    
At compile time, an element typed `dynamic` is assumed to support any operation.
