# Query Operations
LINQ queries can be filtered, sorted (ordered), grouped, joined, and selected:

# Filtering & Sorting (Ordering)
```cs
var queryA = from cust in customers
    where cust.City == "London" // this is the *filter*
    orderby cust.Name ascending // this is the *sorter*
    select cust;
```

# Grouping
The `group` clause results in `queryG` being typed `IEnumerable<IGrouping<string, Customer>>`.  
Each group itself contains a key and a sequence that consists of all members of that group:
```cs
var queryG = from cust in customers
    group cust by cust.City; // `cust.City` is the key for `groupby`
```

To iterate over a query that produces a sequence of groups, use a nested `foreach` loop:
```cs
foreach (var customerGroup in queryG)
    foreach (Customer customer in customerGroup)
        // â€¦
```

## Grouping with into
To refer to the results of a `group` operation directly, use `into` to create an identifier:
```cs
var queryG = from cust in customers
    group cust by cust.City into custGroup // the `custGroup` identifier can be queried further
    where custGroup.Count() > 2
    orderby custGroup.Key
    select custGroup;
```

# Joining
Join operations create associations between sequences that do not otherwise exist:
```cs
var queryJ = from cust in customers
    join dist in distributors on cust.City equals dist.City
    select new { CustomerName = cust.Name, DistributorName = dist.Name };
```

# Selecting
The `select` clause produces the query and specifies the "shape" or type of each element returned.  
A `select` clause that produces a different shape than the source element is a projection.  

# Type Relationships within a Query
```cs
List<string> names = new() { "John", "Rick", "Maggie", "Mary" };
```
