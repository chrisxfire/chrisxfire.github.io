# artificial intelligence
> A field of computer science that seeks to create intelligent machines that can replicate or exceed human intelligence.

# deep learning
> A machine learning technique in which layers of neural networks are used to process data and make decisions.

Related: neural networks

# [generative AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence?WT.mc_id=academic-105485-koreyst) 
> Artificial intelligence that is capable of generating text, images, and other content.  

Related: large language model

# generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)
> A generative AI model that uses a *transformer* architecture.

# machine learning
> A subset of AI that enables machines to learn from existing data and improve upon that data to make
decisions or predictions.

Related: deep learning, neural networks

# large language model
> A generative AI model that receives natural language text as input and generates text as output.

# neural networks
## recurrent neural networks (RNN)

# transformer
> A model architecture based on the *attention* mechanism which allows the model to give different weights
to the inputs it receives by "paying more attention" to the most relevant information.  
- Overcomes limits of neural networks.
