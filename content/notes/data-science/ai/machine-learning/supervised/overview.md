# Abstract
In supervised machine learning, training data includes both *feature* values and *label* values. Models are trained by finding a relationship between the features and labels in past observations so that unknown labels can be predicted in future cases.

Supervised machine learning approaches are categorized as follows:
- [Regression](../regression)
- [Binary classification](../binary-classification)
- [Multi-class classification](../multi-class-classification)
