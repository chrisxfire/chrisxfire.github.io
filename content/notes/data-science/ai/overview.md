# Abstract
TODO: Define AI

Branches of AI:
- Computer Vision
  - Image classification — classifying images based on their contents
  - Object detection — classify individual objects with an image and identify their location in the image
  - Semantic segmentation — individual pixels are classified according to the object to which they belong; used to create overlays and highlights in an image
  - Image analysis — extracting information ("tags") from images to catalog the image or create descriptive captions
  - Face detection, analysis, and recognition — a specialized form of object detection that locates human faces
  - Optical character recognition — detects and reads text in images
- Document Intelligence — managing, processing, and using high volumes of a variety of unstructured data in forms and documents.
- [Generative AI](../../ai/generative-ai/) — takes natural language as input (*prompts*) and returns appropriate responses (*completions*). The completion may be natural language, images, code, or audio.
  - Large Language Models
    - Prompt Engineering 
- Knowledge Mining — extracting information from large volumes of unstructured data.
- [Machine Learning](../../ai/machine-learning/) — using data to create predictive models.
- Natural Language Processing — enable machine understanding of written and spoken language.
