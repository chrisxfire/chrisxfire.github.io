# code blocks

````markdown  
```
function test() {  
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");  
}  
```  
````  

## syntax highlighting
````markdown
```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
````

# color models
![A diagram showing the color models HEX, RGB, and HSL](./color-models.png)

# comments
```markdown
<!-- This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->
```

# diagrams
## [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
````markdown
Here is a simple flow chart:
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
````

## [Math](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics)
Delimit expressions with $:
```markdown
This sentence uses `$` delimiters to show math inline:  $\sqrt{3x-1}+(1+x)^2$
```

![A mathematical expression of the code above](./math.png)

### math expressions as blocks
Use a math code block:
````markdown
**Here is some math!**
```math
\sqrt{3}
```
````

![A mathematical expression of the code above](./math2.png)

# [Emoji](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md)
```markdown
@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:
```
![emoji](emoji.png)

# escaping
Use `\`:  
```markdown
Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.
```

To escape a nested code block, the outer code block needs a different number of backticks than the inner. 

# footnotes
```markdown
Here is a simple footnote[^1].
A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  
You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].
[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
```

# headings
```markdown
# the largest heading
## the second largest heading
###### the smallest heading
```

# horizontal line
`___` (3 or more underscores)

# images
```markdown
![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)
```
