# Committing Changes
Each commit is a snapshot of a project that can be reverted to later.

`git commit` – commits changes and launches text editor to get a commit message
`git commit -m "<message>"` – commits changes and logs the commit with <message>
`git commit -a -m "<msg>"` – adds (stages) every file that is already tracked; commits; logs with <msg>
