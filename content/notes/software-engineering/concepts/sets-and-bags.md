A *set* is a collection of one or more unique objects (no duplicates).  
A *bag* is a collection of one or more objects that may have duplicates.  

The *union* of two sets is the set which contains all the elements of both sets.  
The *intersection* of two sets is the set which contains the common elements of both sets.  
The *except* of two sets is the set of all elements in the first set except those also present in the second set.
