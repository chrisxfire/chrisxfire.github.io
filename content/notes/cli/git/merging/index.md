# Merging Branches
`git merge <branch>` merge branch into the current branch

# Managing Merge Conflicts
- View conflicts with git status.  
- After resolving conflicts, run git add on each file to stage it, which marks it resolved in git.  
- Use git mergetool for a GUI tool to resolve merge conflicts.
