# Abstract
A training from the NeuroLeadership Institute.  

"Knowing bias will help you stop being biased." This is not true.  Bias in the brain operates automatically, unconsciously, and habitually. 

*If you have a brain, you have bias*.

Cognitive biases — mental shortcuts we use to process the world around us. They occur automatically and unconsciously.  These biases cause problems:
* Errors in thinking — in our efforts to simplify, we overlook important information or assume we already know it.
* Rushed decisions.
* Suboptimal outcomes — applying the same solution to a different context and expecting the same result.

There are more than 150 cognitive biases.  The SEEDS&reg; model categorizes them into 5 categories:
1. Similarity
   a. Brains automatically categorize people as *in* group or *out* group. This is why we are biased to feeling more comfortable with people like ourselves.
   b. Biases in this category include *in-group bias* and *out-group bias*.
2. Expedience
   a. Thinking critically uses a lot of energy. To save energy, we use shortcuts. *If it feels right, it must be true*.
   b. Biases in this category include *confirmation bias* and *availability bias*.
3. Experience
   a. Our brains are wired to make us believe that we see the world as it is — that our perceptions are giving us the full picture.
   b. Biases in this category include *blind spot bias* and *fundamental attribution error*.
4. Distance
   a. The brain's proximity network measures distance in time and space, but assigns greater value to things that are neither.
   b. Biases in this category include *temporal discounting* and *affective forecasting*.
5. Safety
   a. The brain's network for detecting threat is larger than detecting rewards.  We place more importance on potential losses than potential gains.  
   b. Biases in this category include *loss aversion* and *framing effects*.

# Approach
1. Label — we must label a bias before we can mitigate it.
2. Mitigate — minimize the effect of bias as much as possible.
3. Engage

# Label
To label bias:
1. Recognize unconscious bias may be present
2. Pause and consider *bias triggers*
3. Identify and label bias

| Do less                                                 | Do more                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assume your decisions are 100% conscious and objective  | Explicitly acknowledge that decisions are subject to unconscious influences |
| Try to fight making biased decisions all the time       | Identify critical decisions that can be derailed by bias                    |
| Take a universal mitigation approach to decision making | Identify and mitigate specific bias triggers                                |

# Mitigate
We cannot turn *knowing about bias* into *doing something about bias* without the right strategies.

Strategies:
1. Preventative measures
2. In the moment strategies
3. If/then planning

| Bias       | Look out for                                    | Mitigation strategy                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Similarity | Decisions involving people                      | Find commonalities with others to move them to your *in-group*                                      |
| Expedience | Hurried decisions                               | Paint a complete picture by gathering relevant information and questioning your initial assumptions |
| Experience | We tend to prefer our own ideas                 | Seek outside perspectives before moving forward with a decision                                     |
| Distance   | Undervaluing people and resources at a distance | Imagine distance is not a factor when assessing people or resources                                 |
| Safety     | Being overly cautious in decision-making        | Consider if you were giving advice on this risk to someone else — would your decision change?       |

In the Moment Mitigation
- Situation: a team meeting in which a new vendor is being selected.
- A: "I want to work with Darrell. I feel like he gets us."  
- B: "Let's imagine we know all the vendors really well. Who is the most likely to deliver the best outcome?"

If/Then Plan Mitigation
- Situation: a team meeting with some members in person, others remote.
- If/then plan: call on people on the phone to speak first.

# Engage
Engage with others to counteract bias. Discuss bias in a non-threatening, accountable way.

## Example
Situation: panel making decision to finalize hiring decision between two candidates.
- One candidate went to same school as 2 from the panel.
- Panel leader says "Let's be careful to avoid similarity bias."
- Panelist imagines that both candidates attended the same school.

This eliminates the *in-group advantage* of one of the candidates.

## Roadblocks to Bias Mitigation
- Bias blind spot — a type of Experience Bias that states it is much easier to spot bias in others than ourselves.  
- Groupthink — a decision-making phenomenon that occurs when the desire for group cohesion or for reaching a conclusion in a short amount of time
becomes more important than making the best choices. 

Engaging others in constructive conversations about bias helps us overcome these and other roadblocks.

In bias mitigation, *diversity* means stimulating people in the room to think differently *and* bringing different people into the room. By bringing 
in diversity, the group assesses information more carefully, resulting in superior performance on complex tasks.
