# hi
I'm Christian, a systems engineer (presently working as a CIO) in Colorado Springs. I build software with .NET (C#) and ASP.NET.

This site hosts my blog where I share my thoughts about software engineering and .NET.  The bulk of the content is under [/notes/](../notes/) where I store my notes on a .NET, ASP.NET, and other technologies.

Feel free to look around and say hello if you like.
