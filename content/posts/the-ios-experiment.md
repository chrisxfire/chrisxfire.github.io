# abstract
First impressions of the iPhone 14 Pro from a long-time Google Android user (since the Nexus One!)

# [✔] likes
- <g>Speed</g>.  It's faster than my most recent Android phone, a Google Pixel 6.  Specifically, it's touchscreen responsiveness is such that it keeps up with me when I type.  At times, when typing fast, my Pixel would "miss" touches—this phone doesn't.
- <g>Display brightness</g>.  I can see the screen in sunlight while wearing sunglasses.  I used to have to peer over my sunglasses to see my Pixel's display in the sun.

# [❌] gripes 
- <r>No way to add a period key to the main keyboard</r>.  Yes, you can add a period with pressing the spacebar twice.  That works nice unless you're trying to enter `firstname.lastname@example.com` in which case you have to press the <kbd>123</kbd> key *six* separate times (to toggle back and forth for both `.`'s and the `@`).
- <r>No way to text from my PC</r>.  With my Pixel, I could text from my PC with either Microsoft Phone Link (a native Windows 10 mobile app) or messages.google.com (a full Google Messages experience via any web browser).  No such feature for iOS.  You can text from a Mac, but not a PC.
- <r>Face unlock</r>.  No fingerprint reader means my phone has to see my face and, if I'm wearing sunglasses, it doesn't recognize me.
