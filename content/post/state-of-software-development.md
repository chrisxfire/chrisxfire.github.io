In 2023, the majority of software on planet Earth is poorly constructed.  This is true for everything from small mobile apps to mid-sized line of business applications to large distributed enterprise systems.  It is true for application software, firmware, operating systems, embedded systems, and IoT systems.  Low quality software exists in both open- and closed-source codebases.  The software we use in our personal and professional lives every day is [unreliable](http://encyclopedia.uia.org/en/problem/unreliability-computer-software).  It [malfunctions](https://www.fox26houston.com/news/bmw-recalling-thousands-of-vehicles-over-software-malfunction).  It [frustrates us](https://www.techradar.com/news/software-frustration-is-costing-workers-millions-of-hours-every-week).  And--worst of all--it [endangers us](https://www.forbes.com/sites/taylorarmerding/2018/11/20/hard-questions-raised-when-a-software-glitch-takes-down-an-airliner/).  It is simply not [fit for purpose](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/fit_for_purpose).  

# the problem: education
Software is--at least at the time of this writing--still built primarily by humans.  At the root of our problem is the education of software developers which is, unfortunately, inadequate at best.

# a potential solution: licensing and certification

- Today's software is poorly constructed
- Reasons:
    - Non-standard training & education
    - Copy / paste developers
    - "Self-trained" developers
    - No accountability
- The need for licensing & certification
    - Bad software costs lives
    - Analogy to civil construction / electricians / beauticians
    - Previous attempts
- Accountability
