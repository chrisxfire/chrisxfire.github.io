In 2023, the majority of software on planet Earth is poorly constructed.  This is the case for everything from small mobile apps for your phone to
mid-sized line of business apps to large, distributed enterprise applications.

- Today's software is poorly constructed
- Reasons:
    - Non-standard training & education
    - Copy / paste developers
    - "Self-trained" developers
    - No accountability
- The need for licensing & certification
    - Bad software costs lives
    - Analogy to civil construction / electricians / beauticians
    - Previous attempts
- Accountability
